Partnering with GenAI for Creative Success AI has come a long way from being a simple tool to becoming a creative partner that enhances our work. The key is understanding how to collaborate with GenAI to amplify human creativity without compromising the originality that makes our work unique. Let’s explore different ways to integrate GenAI into your creative process.\n1. Using GenAI as a Creative Brainstorming Partner AI can be the brainstorming partner you didn’t know you needed. Rather than relying on AI to come up with finished ideas, think of it as a springboard for your thoughts. Use it to generate lists of ideas, outline possible directions for projects, or play with “what if” scenarios to stimulate your imagination.\nExample: Suppose you\u0026rsquo;re planning a new blog series. Ask your Thinking Buddy to suggest topics or outline different perspectives you might not have considered. This helps you step out of your usual thinking patterns and opens up new possibilities.\nTakeaway: Your Thinking Buddy excels in idea generation, but your unique touch is needed to refine and bring those ideas to life.\n2. Collaborating on Storytelling and Writing When working on written projects, whether it’s a novel or an article, GenAI can assist in structuring content or refining language. Think of it as having an experienced editor who suggests better ways to phrase sentences, checks for clarity, or reorganizes paragraphs for improved flow. While your Thinking Buddy can’t fully replace your voice, it acts as a support system that improves the quality of your writing.\nExample: You write a draft chapter of a book. You can rely on your Thinking Buddy to review the content, suggest adjustments to strengthen transitions, or offer summaries of complex sections to ensure reader comprehension.\nTip: Use GenAI’s editing capabilities, but always review and tweak to maintain your personal style.\n3. GenAI for Structuring and Organizing Work For large projects like research papers, business plans, or in-depth reports, GenAI can help by suggesting outlines, reorganizing sections, and summarizing key points. This allows you to focus on refining content rather than spending excess time on structure and format.\nExample: If you’re overwhelmed by scattered notes for an upcoming project, ask your Thinking Buddy to create a cohesive outline or reorganize content by themes. This helps improve your workflow and ensures that all sections are logically connected.\nInsight: Let GenAI assist with organization, but remember that only you can ensure that the content aligns with your objectives and voice.\n4. Enhancing Collaboration and Feedback Loops GenAI can be a great way to simulate the feedback process that might come from a peer review. Ask your Thinking Buddy for critique or alternative approaches to parts of your work. This iterative feedback helps you refine your project and consider new angles.\nExample: You’re working on a presentation and need a second opinion. Use GenAI to review your key points and suggest alternative ideas or highlight potential areas for improvement.\nWhy This Works: Your Thinking Buddy won\u0026rsquo;t replace human feedback but can supplement it by providing suggestions that push you to think more critically about your work.\n5. Balancing Automation and Creativity Finding the right balance between automation and human input ensures your project maintains a unique perspective. GenAI can handle repetitive tasks like formatting or basic edits, freeing you to focus on creative aspects.\nExample: Use GenAI to proofread a final draft or apply consistent formatting across a document. This way, you can direct your energy toward content refinement and storytelling.\nKey Insight: Let your Thinking Buddy take care of repetitive or low-level tasks, but maintain a hands-on approach to creative decisions and personal touches.\nFinal Thoughts: Embracing AI as a Creative Partner Working with GenAI in creative projects isn’t about handing over the reins; it’s about enhancing your process and extending your creative reach. When used thoughtfully, AI becomes a powerful ally that supports your work while letting your voice shine through.\nYour Turn: Consider how your Thinking Buddy can be integrated into your next project. Experiment with it as a brainstorming partner, an editor, or a project organizer, and find the balance that works best for your creative process.\n","date":"November 18, 2024","hero":"/posts/gen_ai/week_08/article/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/gen_ai/week_08/article/","summary":"Explore how AI can act as a partner in your creative projects, enhancing writing, brainstorming, and editing.

GenAI as a Tool for Self-Exploration When we think of GenAI, productivity or creativity often comes to mind. But beyond these functions, GenAI can be a powerful partner in self-exploration. Acting as an unprejudiced Thinking Buddy, it encourages deeper reflection, helps identify core values, and even questions long-held assumptions—all with an open mind and a will to help.\nIn today’s article, we’ll discuss different self-reflection ideas that we can apply with GenAI to explore various facets of personal growth, from understanding your core beliefs to clarifying life goals.\n1. Defining Core Values and Virtues Core values shape our decisions and define who we are. But have you ever taken the time to write them down? Throughout history, influential figures like Benjamin Franklin reflected on specific virtues they wanted to embody. This practice made them more intentional and mindful in their daily lives. With GenAI as your Thinking Buddy, you can engage in this same exercise. Use it to brainstorm and refine the values that guide you, helping you articulate what you want to practice and be known for.\nPrompt to Try: Do you know Benjamin Franklin's 13 virtues? First, tell me more about that. Then, help me reflect on my core values and virtues. Ask questions that guide me to identify what I truly value in life and why. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Why This Works: By generating questions that prompt introspection, your Thinking Buddy acts as a mirror, encouraging you to explore what virtues resonate with you.\n2. Creating a Personal Mission and Vision Statement and a Strategy to Get There A clear mission and vision can be transformative, giving your life direction and purpose. Just as prominent leaders like Gandhi and Nelson Mandela align their actions with their values, you too can gain focus by defining your mission. GenAI can assist by asking targeted questions that help you articulate your long-term aspirations. This reflective work helps with aligning your daily actions with your greater purpose, turning abstract goals into actionable strategies. You can also rely on your Thinking Buddy to build a comprehensive roadmap to achieve your mission: from setting specific objectives to identifying milestone checkpoints, it can help lay out steps that adapt as you evolve.\nPrompt to Try: Help me draft a personal mission and vision statement that aligns with my goals. I want to be able to define a strategy that gets me there, but that is flexible enough that will let me accomodate all the different oportunities that might come along the way. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Outcome: A mission statement serves as your compass. Using your Thinking Buddy’s assistance, you can refine your thoughts and put them into a clear and motivating statement.\n3. Challenging Personal Assumptions and Biases We all carry biases that impact our actions and perspectives. Often, these biases go unnoticed unless we actively reflect on them. GenAI can act as a prompt generator, offering questions that encourage deep introspection to uncover hidden assumptions. This process can lead to more thoughtful decisions and a balanced view of the world, helping you approach life with a higher awareness.\nPrompt to Try: I am about to start a new role as *[insert role here]*. I want to make sure I'm not bringing unconscious biases or assumptions into this role. Help me dig deeper to assess whether I am missing something I should take care of so I can do a better job. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Insight: By framing thought-provoking questions, your Thinking Buddy fosters a space to examine and challenge your perspectives, leading to personal growth and deeper understanding.\n4. Exploring Deep, Hypothetical Conversations Engaging in deep, hypothetical conversations can unlock new ways of thinking and problem-solving.

Exploring Common Myths Through Hands-On Scenarios In Monday’s article, we debunked some widespread myths about GenAI. Today, we’ll put these insights into practice with specific examples to illustrate where GenAI falls short. By seeing real outputs, we’ll understand how to navigate GenAI’s capabilities and limitations with confidence.\nThe Tool of the Week: Use Constraints to Focus Output Before diving in, let\u0026rsquo;s spotlight the featured tool:\nUse Constraints to Focus Output Setting constraints like word limits, formatting, content type, helps guide GenAI’s responses to fit your specific needs. While the results may not always be perfect, they show the potential of using boundaries to shape AI’s output.\n1. GenAI Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Know Everything I put GenAI to the test by asking about my research papers. It then responded simple, “I don’t have information on that,” indicating that GenAI, despite being well-read, isn’t omniscient.\nWithout searching the web: tell me about a research paper from Fernando Yanez, a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Result: The AI’s response made it clear—its knowledge has limitations, and its results may not include content that are not widely publicized, especially if it hasn’t been incorporated into its training set.\nTakeaway: Use GenAI for broad insights but verify details on niche topics or personal work independently.\n2. GenAI Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Always Deliver the Right Answer Even after following up with questions about my pre-October 2023 research, GenAI was unable to provide an answer. This underscores that GenAI can sometimes fail to retrieve lesser-known information, even if it\u0026rsquo;s publicly available, because such data may not be sufficiently represented in its training dataset.\nWithout searching the web: then tell me about his research prior to October 2023 Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Observation: In this instance, GenAI couldn\u0026rsquo;t provide the desired information. However, there are cases where it generates summaries that sound credible but may lack factual accuracy upon verification. This demonstrates that even with extensive training data, GenAI\u0026rsquo;s responses might not always align with the actual facts.\nTakeaway: Use GenAI\u0026rsquo;s outputs as starting points or ideas for further exploration rather than accepting them as definitive answers.\n3. GenAI’s Output is as Good as Its Prompt The quality of GenAI\u0026rsquo;s output hinges on the clarity and detail of its input. Broad prompts result in generic content, while precise prompts guide GenAI to generate tailored, meaningful results. A well-crafted, specific prompt can dramatically elevate the response quality.\nHere is an example of a generic prompt: Generate creative content in 100 words. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Result: The response to this is typically very general and not customized to our needs.\nNow here is an example of a detailed prompt: In 100 words, no more, no less, create a story set on an upside-down planet where plants speak and animals are mute. In this world, there is no wind; even so, plants move consciously as it is part of their multimodal language. The third element of this multimodal language between plants is synaptic connections between roots. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Result: With a detailed prompt like this, GenAI can craft more vivid and focused narratives.\nConclusion: The more context and detail you provide in your prompt, the higher the quality of the response. Investing time in creating a clear, specific prompt can lead to more impressive, targeted results.\n4. GenAI Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Understand Context as Well as Humans Do In the previous prompt example, we noted that plants in this fictional world use a multimodal means of communication with three elements. We explicitly describe the kinetic and synaptic aspects. However, sound was implied through the phrase “an upside-down planet where plants speak and animals are mute.” It is easy for us to infer that, unlike mute animals, plants produce sounds in such a world. Yet, GenAI mentioned “silent debates” among the plants. This oversight highlights its struggle with nuanced context. While GenAI correctly included movement and synaptic connections, it missed the auditory element implied in the prompt.\nInsight: This example shows that even with detailed prompts, GenAI may fail to fully comprehend complex relationships or implied details, emphasizing the need for human review to ensure accuracy and depth.\n5. GenAI Doesn\u0026rsquo;t Handle Every Task Perfectly Adding constraints to prompts can test GenAI’s precision. In this case, even when given precise instructions to write 100 words—not more, not less—both generated stories had 99 words. This shows that GenAI may fail in some tasks requiring exact adherence to detailed criteria.\nInsight: While GenAI can approach the target closely, human oversight ensures adherence to precise details.\nTool of the Week Reflection Using constraints like word limits can guide AI effectively. Despite falling short by one word, it stayed within the general boundary, preventing overly long responses. This shows how leveraging constraints focuses output, even if perfection isn\u0026rsquo;t guaranteed.\nFinal Thoughts: Balance, Not Perfection These examples demonstrate that our Thinking Buddy, while powerful, has its limitations. Understanding where it may falter—be it in handling precise instructions, interpreting nuanced prompts, or drawing from specific data—enables us to use it more effectively as a Thinking Buddy. When approached with clear prompts and constraints, GenAI’s assistance can be invaluable, but human oversight ensures the best results.\n","date":"November 7, 2024","hero":"/posts/gen_ai/week_06/tutorial/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/gen_ai/week_06/tutorial/","summary":"Uncover and challenge common misconceptions about GenAI with hands-on examples that demonstrate its capabilities and boundaries.","tags":["Week 6","GenAI Myths","AI Limitations","Practical Examples"],"title":"Hands-On: Debunking GenAI Myths with Real-Life Examples"},{"categories":["AI in Everyday Life","Setting Expectations"],"contents":" Image by DALL-E. Setting the Record Straight on GenAI: Myths vs. Reality Generative AI has rapidly gained popularity, and it’s easy to see why. It’s a powerful tool for idea generation, productivity, and even daily tasks. But like many emerging technologies, GenAI comes with its fair share of myths and misconceptions. Just as we discussed common mistakes we usually make in last week’s post, this week, let’s explore what GenAI can realistically do—and where it might come up short.\nIn this article, we’ll clear up some of the most common misunderstandings about GenAI, setting realistic expectations so you can get the most out of it without getting frustrated by its limitations.\n1. Myth: AI Knows Everything It’s tempting to think of GenAI as an all-knowing entity with access to any answer at the click of a button. After all, it’s trained on vast amounts of data. However, GenAI doesn’t “know” anything in the way we think of knowledge. It generates responses based on probabilities and patterns, and it doesn’t inherently understand the information it produces—yet, at least.\nReality: Think of GenAI as more of a well-read assistant than an all-knowing oracle. It can provide information from its training data, but its “knowledge” stops at its last update. If you’re asking about current events, niche topics, or straight-up facts, consider verifying with trusted sources or using it as a starting point rather than a final answer.\nTip: Use your Thinking Buddy as a tool to get initial insights or directions, especially on general topics, but don’t rely on it for sensitive or highly specialized information without fact-checking.\n2. Myth: GenAI Always Delivers the Right Answer It’s easy to expect AI to consistently provide accurate, spot-on responses. In reality, GenAI works by generating the “most likely” response based on patterns in its training data—not by guaranteeing accuracy. Sometimes, it might even be confidently incorrect, especially if the topic is nuanced or complex.\nReality: GenAI is a tool for exploration, not a guarantee. Even though it can respond with confidence, its answers should be considered as suggestions rather than definitive facts.\nTip: Take GenAI’s responses with a grain of salt. If you’re using it for something important, like a research project or strategic decision, double-check the information to ensure its accuracy. Your Thinking Buddy is at its best when treated as a brainstorming partner, not an ultimate authority.\n3. Myth: AI Understands Context as Well as a Human Because GenAI can tailor its responses based on prompts, it can feel like it “gets” us. But in truth, AI has no real understanding of human context or subtlety. It generates responses based on cues you provide, without fully “grasping” the nuances of human experience.\nReality: Your Thinking Buddy is great at following structured prompts but can get off-track without explicit guidance. For instance, it may not recognize off the bat when a task requires extra empathy, creativity, or ethical judgment.\nTip: For better results, provide clear, structured prompts. Think of AI as a rule follower—it’ll perform best when you guide it with specific context and expectations. Don’t assume it “knows” what you mean without clarification.\n4. Myth: AI Can Handle Every Task on Its Own A common misconception is that GenAI can do everything from start to finish without human input. But GenAI works best as a collaborator rather than a solo performer, especially for tasks involving complex planning, sensitive decisions, or multiple steps.\nReality: Think of your Thinking Buddy as a partner who’s ready to assist but needs your oversight to stay on track. It can brainstorm ideas, generate rough drafts, and even automate certain tasks, but ultimately, you’ll need to review and refine its work.\nTip: Use AI to jumpstart projects or handle specific parts of a workflow. Treat it as a co-worker who gets the job done but benefits from a bit of feedback and guidance to deliver results that align with your goals.\nReal-World Scenarios: Where GenAI Excels To understand the true potential of GenAI, let’s look at areas where it truly shines. Each of these scenarios taps into the specific strengths of GenAI while keeping the human touch essential for added nuance and personalization.\n1. Content Drafting and Idea Generation Your Thinking Buddy can help create social media drafts, and unique angles for marketing copy.

Instead of expecting it to do everything, view it as a capable assistant that can handle specific tasks with your guidance. Whether you’re exploring new ideas, drafting content, or automating routine tasks, GenAI works best when it’s integrated thoughtfully into your workflow.\nRely on your Thinking Buddy as a support system that augments your capabilities—and remember, it’s a learning journey. When we approach GenAI with realistic expectations, we can unlock its full potential without disappointment.\n","date":"November 4, 2024","hero":"/posts/gen_ai/week_06/article/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/gen_ai/week_06/article/","summary":"Uncover the truths behind popular AI myths and see where GenAI excels—and where it doesn’t—so you can make the most of this tech in your daily life.","tags":["Week 6","GenAI Insights","AI Expectations","Myths and Realities"],"title":"Breaking Down AI Myths: What GenAI Can and Can't Do for You"},{"categories":["Self-Improvement","Technology","AI in Everyday Life"],"contents":" Image by DALL-E. GenAI as a Learning Companion When we start integrating our use of GenAI into our daily lives, it is easy to fall into common mistakes—as we saw in Monday\u0026rsquo;s article. For instance, when learning something new, it’s easy to get limited answers from search engines or even GenAI if we don’t ask the right follow-up questions. This hands-on guide explores how using iterative feedback with GenAI—a little like having a conversation with an incredibly knowledgeable friend, a Thinking Buddy, if you will—can elevate your learning experience. Rather than stopping at the first response, we’ll use feedback to ask clarifying questions, refine answers, and dig deeper into complex ideas.\nToday’s focus is habit formation as our learning topic, but feel free to adapt this process to anything you’re curious about!\nThe Tool of the Week: Feedback Loop This week’s tool is a powerful one:\nFeedback Loop Using GenAI’s iterative feedback capability allows us to prompt it with additional instructions and feedback to gradually the journey over several steps. Instead of one broad answer, you’re creating more comprehensive and nuanced responses by treating your Thinking Buddy as a conversation partner.\nHere’s how you might start and refine the conversation to create a richer learning experience.\nStep-by-Step: Deepening Your Learning Experiences with GenAI Step 1: Begin with a Broad Question Start with a general question to give your Thinking Buddy some context about your topic. For this particular example, let’s ask a straightforward question about habit formation:\nI want to learn about habit formation. What are the basics I should know? Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT This prompt helps establish foundational ideas, likely introducing concepts like cue-routine-reward or the importance of repetition. Starting broadly gives your Thinking Buddy room to offer an overview, setting the stage for more specific questions.\nWhat we get: GenAI may explain basic principles from well-known frameworks, like the habit loop popularized by Charles Duhigg’s The Power of Habit. From here, we’re ready to dive deeper.\nStep 2: Request Practical Steps Next, narrow the scope to focus on actionable steps. This transition turns general concepts into specific actions that you can test in daily life.\nWhat about practical steps? How can I start applying the cue-routine-reward loop to build a daily reading habit? Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Why this works: This prompt builds on the earlier answer and lets your Thinking Buddy know you’re looking for practical applications. You’ll likely get suggestions like setting a specific cue (e.g., time or visual), a routine (reading for a small amount of time), and a reward (a treat or a progress tracker).\nNote: Feel free to ask for adjustments if the response doesn’t align with your goals. For instance, if GenAI suggests unrealistic daily goals, ask for smaller steps.\nStep 3: Clarify for Personalization To get answers that feel more tailored, add personal context or specific details. This can make the response more relevant to your needs.\nThat sounds nice but, being honest here, I find it hard to stay motivated after a few days. What strategies can help me with long-term consistency? Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT What this does: Adding this detail tells GenAI that you’re looking for strategies to stay committed, not just the basics. It might suggest advanced techniques like habit stacking or finding accountability in others to keep you motivated. By layering on more personal context, you’re guiding your Thinking Buddy to respond with advice that feels applicable to you.\nStep 4: Ask for Clarifications or Relate your Learning Experience to Other Ideas Sometimes, you might have something in mind that would help your learning journey. Don’t be afraid to ask your Thinking Buddy to help you connect the dots. For instance, we can ask it to relate habit formation with the Four Tendencies by Gretchen Rubin.\nI see. I think that makes sense and it is doable. In the topic of motivation, though, I read a great book by Gretchen Rubin called \"The Four Tendencies\". It explains how people manage both internal and external expectations. I find that this relates very much to how we approach habit formation. How could we integrate this idea into our conversation? Can you give me a two-liner about each tendency and how people could \"hack\" their habit formation practice based on their tendencies? Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Why this is important: GenAI is more effective when we engage with it as a conversational partner. One of its most useful abilities is being able to connect and extrapolate ideas. You can either point them out yourself (as we just did) or ask it to think outside the box. You will be amazed by the connections it can make!\nStep 5: Export Your Learning Journey\u0026rsquo;s Conclusions Once you’ve refined your learning experience, you can ask your Thinking Buddy to summarize the main points and give you the takeaways. Following the GenAI tool from last week\u0026rsquo;s Hands-On, you can also specify the format for the response.\nIn our example, it can be helpful to track your progress in a structured format to help you build a reading habit. Creating a habit tracker with a table outlining your routine makes it easy to see your commitment in action, day by day. Here’s how to build a tracker with GenAI and export it for easy access.\nNow let's generate a spreadsheet in table format for a reading habit tracker that I can download. Include columns for ‘Day,’ ‘Reading Time (mins),’ ‘Book Title/Chapter,’ ‘Goal Met? (Yes/No),’ and ‘Notes.’ Also, add a section at the top with my reading routine: I will read for 10 minutes every evening after dinner, and I'll check in weekly to track my progress. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Your Thinking Buddy will now generate a table template you can use to log daily reading habits, complete with a customizable header for your personal routine.\nHere is my full conversation with my Thinking Buddy in case you want to take a look!\nFinal Thoughts: Using GenAI to Learn, Not Just to Answer With GenAI, you have a learning companion in your Thinking Buddy who won’t judge your questions and is always ready for one more round of iterations. This hands-on approach can make GenAI much more than just a search tool—it becomes a study buddy, one that grows more helpful with each layer of feedback you provide.\nLearning is a journey, and by iterating and refining your questions, you can take GenAI along for the ride. Take some time today to try these steps out with any topic you’d like to explore. The conversation might surprise you!\nYour Turn: Ready to turn GenAI into your learning companion? Head to ChatGPT and start a conversation that builds on itself. Remember, it’s about refining answers, learning together, and discovering insights in a way that’s both engaging and enlightening.\n","date":"October 31, 2024","hero":"/posts/gen_ai/week_05/tutorial/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/gen_ai/week_05/tutorial/","summary":"Learn how to use GenAI as a conversational partner for learning and discovery, refining answers for deeper understanding.","tags":["Week 5","Learning with GenAI","AI Tools","Generative AI"],"title":"Hands-On: Deepen Your Learning Journey with GenAI"},{"categories":["AI in Everyday Life","Best Practices"],"contents":" Image by DALL-E. Learning the Ropes: GenAI Mistakes to Avoid Starting with Generative AI (GenAI) feels a bit like meeting up with a very knowledgeable friend from high school who’s now practically a walking encyclopedia. They’ve got a Ph.D. in just about everything, and they’re ready to help! But, as smart as they are, they’re still human (okay, not quite human) and might make a mistake here and there. Instead of giving up at the first slip-up, we can navigate these quirks, refine our prompts, and build a reliable AI companion.\nHere are six common GenAI pitfalls I encountered when first diving in and have seen others make the same mistakes. They all come with practical ways to avoid them.\n1. Expecting Perfection from GenAI Imagine you’re reconnecting with that brilliant friend from high school who’s now your go-to for any question—tech, health, travel plans, they have a Ph.D. in it all. But despite their incredible knowledge, they’re only human and sometimes make mistakes. GenAI is a lot like that friend: it’s here to offer guidance, but it’s still learning and can be a little overconfident in its answers.\nSolution: When using GenAI, think of it as a collaborative partner, not a perfect solution. Double-check its suggestions, especially if you’re asking about something important. Just like you’d verify advice from a friend, fact-check GenAI’s responses and see them as a starting point rather than a final answer. If it makes a mistake, take it in stride—note the error and continue working together. This approach helps you maintain trust in GenAI’s potential while keeping realistic expectations.\n2. Not Providing Enough Context A common mistake is expecting meaningful results from a one-liner like, “What should I do today?” It’s a lot like asking your well-informed friend an open-ended question without any context—they’d need some details to give useful advice.\nSolution: Give GenAI a few clues to guide its response. Instead of “What should I do today?” try something more specific, like “I’m visiting New York, love history, and want to avoid large crowds.” By including details like preferences, location, or goals, you’ll receive answers that are tailored to your needs. Think of it like having a conversation with a friend—provide just enough context to help GenAI get where you’re coming from, and it’ll surprise you with relevant, thoughtful responses.\n3. Limiting Use Due to Privacy Concerns Privacy is a natural concern, and it’s easy to feel wary of sharing anything with GenAI. Many avoid using GenAI altogether, worried that it will retain every word, even with privacy settings. It’s true we should be cautious, but GenAI tools often have privacy options that can address these concerns.\nSolution: Disable memory or learning features and stick to general queries rather than personal information if privacy is a top priority. Just like on social media or messaging apps, avoid including highly sensitive information. Most GenAI tools offer ways to prevent long-term data storage—similar to going incognito on your browser. Use it wisely, and you’ll find it’s possible to access GenAI’s benefits without sacrificing peace of mind.\n4. Ending the Conversation Too Soon Another common misstep is not taking advantage of GenAI’s iterative responses. Sometimes we stop at the first reply, missing the chance for better answers by refining the conversation, a lot like stopping mid-conversation with that brilliant friend.\nSolution: Use follow-up prompts to get closer to the answer you’re seeking. Ask GenAI to clarify if the first response doesn’t hit the mark or guide it with additional questions like “Can you rephrase that in simpler terms?” A little back-and-forth helps GenAI refine its responses, just as it would with a human. By keeping the conversation going, you’ll see your results become increasingly meaningful and helpful.\n5. Expecting a Fully Finished Answer for Complex Problems While GenAI can assist in fields like coding, finance, or technical areas, it shouldn’t be expected to give fully structured, bullet-proof arguments for specialized fields. Think of it like talking to that high school friend who’s now an academic—they can offer insights, but they’re not going to hand over a ready-to-go professional document.\nFor example, a lawyer friend recently mentioned they wouldn’t use GenAI for complete arguments but found it helpful to test the strength of their reasoning. They used it to point out weak spots in their draft arguments, which they could then improve.\nSolution: Rather than expecting a complete answer, use GenAI for feedback, outline suggestions, or draft ideas that you can refine yourself. This approach works particularly well in areas where expertise is critical. It’s like getting a second opinion that highlights possible improvements rather than delivering a final, professional-grade product.\n6. Misunderstanding Task Goals and Getting Off-Track Sometimes, users start working with GenAI and assume it understands what they’re after, leading to responses that don’t quite fit. This is like asking your well-informed friend for advice without clarifying your goal—they may answer based on their interpretation of your needs rather than what you actually intended.\nSolution: Make sure GenAI is on the same page before diving in. One way to do this is to prompt it to explain what it thinks you’re looking to achieve. For instance, say, “Can you summarize the task we’re working on?” or ask, “What questions would help you understand this better?” This will let you confirm that it’s interpreting your prompt correctly and give you a chance to clear up any confusion early on. By setting clear goals, you’re guiding GenAI to produce responses that align with what you need.\nFinal Thoughts: Navigating Your GenAI Journey The best way to make GenAI a productive part of your routine is to approach it with a learning mindset and clear communication. You don’t expect a human friend to be perfect, so approach GenAI with the same patience. With the right prompts, context, and realistic expectations, it can be an excellent partner for everything from brainstorming to solving complex challenges.\n","date":"October 28, 2024","hero":"/posts/gen_ai/week_05/article/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/gen_ai/week_05/article/","summary":"Explore common mistakes users make with GenAI, and get tips to overcome these obstacles and make AI a helpful companion.","tags":["Week 5","GenAI Tips","Getting Started","Mistakes and Tips"],"title":"Common GenAI Mistakes and How to Avoid Them"},{"categories":["Creativity","Family","AI in Everyday Life"],"contents":" Image by DALL-E.

Imagine creating a unique story for your child, niece, nephew, where the main character has their name, favorite animals, or even goes on adventures in familiar places. Today, we’ll explore how to use GenAI to craft custom bedtime stories that capture your child’s imagination. We’ll also tap into a handy GenAI tool, Specifying the Format, so you can download the story in formats like pdf for reading on your device during bedtime (even .doc or .csv if you are working with documents or tables, respectively).\nHang on until the end to read the full conversation with Chat GPT!\nThe Tool of the Week: Specifying the Format First up, let’s talk about our featured tool for this week:\nSpecify the Format By specifying the format, we can make sure that the AI provides the story in the way we want to access it. For example, if we’d like to download it as a pdf, we can let the AI know right in the prompt. This means the story will be easy to access on most devices. Here’s an example prompt:\nWrite a bedtime story in pdf format about a young girl named Natalia who befriends a talking panda and learns about the stars on a magical night adventure. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT By adding the format, GenAI will prepare the story in a downloadable version, ready for tonight’s storytime.\nStep-by-Step: Creating a Custom Bedtime Story Step 1: Assign a Role and Tone As we saw during the hands-on of week 1 and week 2, setting up the role and tone give the GenAI a clear direction on how to formulate its answer. Let it know the type of story you’re looking for by assigning it the role of a bedtime storyteller. Then, add details on the tone you’d like, whether it’s soothing, magical, funny, or adventurous.\nYou are a bedtime storyteller. We will write a gentle, magical story for a child who loves animals. The story should include a fox and a deer who explore an enchanted forest together with their wizard friend Lucas. What storylines can you think of? Give me five options. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT What this does: By setting the role and tone, the GenAI understands that the story should be calm and magical, creating an atmosphere perfect for bedtime.\nStep 2: Provide Personal Context for Customization Next, personalize the story a bit more by adding details that will make it special. Think about your some interests or favorite things, and include them in the prompt. This could be as simple as a name, favorite animal, or even a theme like outer space or underwater adventures.\nLet's go with the third option. Lucas is 4 years old and loves solving puzzles. He also learned about taking care of nature at school this week, so we can also add that into the story. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Why this works: Adding these details makes the story feel custom-made, making the experience even more memorable.\nStep 3: Specify the Output Format for Easy Download Finally, made any edits if necessary and specify the format you’d like the story in. This is particularly useful if you want to store it on a device or print it out for easy access.\nNow give me the story in pdf format and give me the step-by-step to open it on my phone so I can read it during bedtime. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT The result: A ready-to-download story that you can easily read before bed, adding a magical ending to the day.\nFinal Thoughts: Personalizing Bedtime with AI Creating a custom bedtime story adds an extra touch to the end of the day. Using GenAI, we can craft stories that not only engage our children but also become a special part of their routine. With tools like tone-setting, context details, and format options, the story you create can feel truly unique and meaningful.\nTry experimenting with different themes and characters that reflect what your child loves—you might be surprised at the endless possibilities.\nHere is the link to the full conversation with ChatGPT!\nYour Turn: Create a Story Tonight!

AI as Your Writing Partner Whether you’re staring at a blank page or deep into writing your next chapter, creative writing comes with its share of highs and lows. Luckily, Generative AI has become a valuable partner for writers of all levels, providing new ways to generate ideas, craft dialogue, and push through writer\u0026rsquo;s block. In today\u0026rsquo;s post, we\u0026rsquo;ll explore how AI can enhance your writing process—from brainstorming fresh ideas to building entire scenes with you. Let’s dive into how this technology can boost your creativity and make your writing life a little easier.\nUsing AI for Idea Generation We’ve all been there—stuck without knowing what to write about or how to take a story forward. Sometimes, the hardest part is simply getting started. This is where AI steps in as an idea generator. Tools like ChatGPT can quickly help brainstorm new plots, characters, or even twists that you might not have thought of yourself.\nFor example, if you’re writing a sci-fi novel but feel stuck on where to take the storyline, you can prompt ChatGPT with:\nI’m working on a sci-fi novel where the protagonist discovers they have the power to alter reality. Can you suggest three unexpected plot twists for the second half of the story? I want it to be related to their relationship with someone very close to them. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT This gives you a fresh angle, and the AI’s suggestions can help spark new directions for your story.\nPractical Use: You can also ask for character development ideas, setting details, or even writing prompts to get things rolling. By collaborating with AI, you can push beyond the usual clichés and discover surprising elements that enhance your storytelling.\nBuilding with AI: Dialogue and Story Scenes Imagine you’re writing a novel or screenplay and need help crafting dialogue between two characters. AI can step in to build sections with you—acting like a writing partner to bounce ideas off of.\nHere’s how it works: You provide a scenario or description of the characters and let the AI help develop the conversation. Try something like this:\nI’m writing a scene where two best friends have an argument over one of them moving away. Can you write a dialogue that balances the tension but also shows how much they care for each other? Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT The AI will help write natural dialogue while still leaving room for your own adjustments. You can also tweak the tone to match the emotional beats you’re looking for.\nPro Tip: Try adjusting the tone of the AI\u0026rsquo;s responses. Ask for it to be lighthearted or serious depending on the vibe you’re going for in your scene.\nOvercoming Writer’s Block Let’s face it, writer’s block can derail your progress when you least expect it. But here’s the good news: AI can offer a helping hand by giving you that creative nudge when your inspiration runs low. When you\u0026rsquo;re stuck, GenAI can help outline the next steps or fill in gaps in your story.\nFor instance, if you’re midway through your novel and unsure where to go next, you can prompt:\nI’m writing a mystery novel where the main character is a detective. I’m stuck on how to transition from discovering a clue to confronting the villain. Can you suggest a transition scene that keeps the suspense high? Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT You’ll receive a quick idea or scene outline, which can jumpstart your creativity and help you move past that block.\nFinal Thoughts: AI as a Creative Partner Incorporating GenAI into your creative writing doesn’t mean handing over the reins—it’s about finding a partner to help spark ideas, push boundaries, and fill in the gaps when you need that extra boost. Whether it’s writing dialogue, generating new plots, or brainstorming with contextual prompts, AI can be a powerful tool for unlocking your creativity.\nThe next time you\u0026rsquo;re struggling with a blank page, try teaming up with AI to see where your imagination takes you. Who knows? You might discover a whole new way to approach your creative projects.\nYour Turn: Experiment with AI in Writing What are you working on right now? Why not try using GenAI to generate some new ideas for your writings? Head to ChatGPT and see what creative spark it can bring to your flow.

A Simple Workflow for Small Wins You know those little tasks that somehow end up taking more time than they should? Things like organizing meeting notes, sending follow-up emails, or even just keeping your team in the loop? These small but constant tasks can add up. That’s why today, we’re diving into how to automate your daily workflow with GenAI as your personal assistant to get these tasks off your plate.\nHow to Provide Contextual Information with Generative AI Let’s introduce the tool of the week:\nProviding Contextual Information A pro tip to make your interactions more effective: use Contextual Information in your prompts. By giving the AI some background, you’ll get results that are way more tailored to what you need. For example, you might say:\nWe are a design agency. We just had a meeting was about a weekly project status update. Key team members involved: Sarah (lead designer), John (project manager), and Mary (client liaison). Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT By providing more context, you’re helping the AI understand the specifics of your situation and give better, more relevant results.\nWhy Small Wins with AI Matter Sometimes we think of AI as this big, complicated thing that solves major problems—but I’m here to tell you, it’s also the perfect sidekick for those small, everyday wins. Automating these repetitive, tedious tasks means you’re freeing up mental space for things that really matter. Whether it\u0026rsquo;s work-related or personal stuff, AI helps streamline it all.\nStep-by-Step: Simple Workflow Automation Let’s walk through how you can use GenAI for automating some small but essential tasks after your meetings, from creating notes to updating stakeholders.\nStep 1: Summarize Meeting Notes First things first—after a meeting, you\u0026rsquo;ll need to capture key points and decisions. With AI, instead of manually writing these notes, you can input a prompt that helps generate them for you. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to set it up:\nI need to summarize our team meeting from today. We discussed three key projects and made decisions regarding next steps. Can you help me create a summary that I can share with the team? [_Insert meeting's transcripts here_]. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT This will give you a clean, concise recap of the meeting that you can quickly share internally. No more fumbling around trying to remember the details!\nStep 2: Turn Notes into Action Items Next up, turn those meeting notes into a clear list of action items for your team. This step is crucial for keeping everyone accountable and ensuring the follow-ups are clear. AI can easily help you break down the discussion points into actionable steps:\nBased on the meeting summary, help me create a list of action items. Make sure to specify who is responsible for each task and the deadlines we agreed on. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT This step ensures that your team knows what they need to focus on—and it keeps everyone on track without you manually writing everything out.\nStep 3: Create Automated Update Emails for External Stakeholders Finally, if your meeting involved decisions that affect external stakeholders (clients, partners, etc.), you’ll need to send them updates. Instead of drafting these emails from scratch, let AI do the heavy lifting. Here\u0026rsquo;s how you can use a simple prompt:\nI need to send an update to our marketing agency about the changes we agreed on during today’s meeting. We decided to increase the ad spend by 15% and update the creatives. Could you draft an email for me? Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT With this, you\u0026rsquo;ll get a ready-to-send email that you can personalize if needed.\nFinal Takeaways Small tasks like meeting notes, action items, and follow-up emails can be time-consuming—but they don’t have to be. AI is perfect for these small wins, letting you automate workflows and reclaim more of your time. Remember to use context when prompting, so the AI can better assist you.\nYour Turn: Try It Out! Next time you have a meeting, give these steps a shot. Use ChatGPT to help with your notes, action items, and emails. It’s not about AI taking over—it\u0026rsquo;s about partnering with AI to make your day smoother and more efficient.\n","date":"October 17, 2024","hero":"/posts/gen_ai/week_03/tutorial/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/gen_ai/week_03/tutorial/","summary":"Learn how to set up an AI-powered workflow to automate small tasks and reclaim your time.","tags":["Week 3","Automation","Workflow","AI Tools","Small Wins"],"title":"Hands-On: Automating Your Routine with GenAI"},{"categories":["Technology","AI in Everyday Life","Productivity"],"contents":" Image by DALL-E. Automate Small Daily Tasks with AI: Saving Time for What Matters We all have those small, repetitive tasks that feel like they take up way more time than they should. Whether it’s figuring out what to cook, staying consistent with your workouts, or just journaling your thoughts, these little things can sometimes feel like a chore because of the mental load they take. That’s where AI can be a game-changer—taking on these small tasks, so you can focus on the things that really matter. Today, we’re going to look at how you can use AI to win back some of that mental space—and hang tight for the pro tip you can easily apply to most scenarios.\nWhy Small Wins Matter We often think of AI as a tool for solving big, complex problems, but sometimes it’s the small, everyday tasks that feel the most draining. By automating these smaller tasks, AI helps free up your brainpower for the things that actually matters to you. Let’s dive into some examples of AI-powered \u0026ldquo;small wins\u0026rdquo; that can make a difference.\n1. GenAI for Meal Planning \u0026amp; Grocery List Creation Imagine coming home after a busy day and having no idea what to make for dinner. Instead of going straight for cereal, or worse, staring at your fridge for 20 minutes, you could use AI to plan your meals for the week and even generate a grocery list based on what you need.\nHow it works: GenAI tools like ChatGPT can create a meal plan based on your preferences and even suggest recipes using ingredients you already have. It can also generate a full shopping list for you to hit the grocery store.\nExample prompt:\nCan you help me plan healthy dinners for the next 5 days, and also make a grocery list for me? You should know I already have some basics like eggs, milk, butter, and bread that I would like to finish this week. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Small Win: In just a few minutes, you’ve got a whole week of meals sorted, and a grocery list ready to go. No more last-minute decisions or wasting time thinking about dinner.\n2. Workout Planning Made Easy Keeping up with a workout routine can be tough, especially when you’re not sure what to do next. In my case, I usually end up skipping the gym because the thought of having to figuring out an exercise routine for the day daunts me. Then, I call my GenAI buddy, ChatGPT: it helps me create a workout plan based on my schedule, goals, preferences, and I can even specify what equipment I have access to.\nHow it works: Tools like ChatGPT can generate a workout plan tailored to your fitness goals. Whether you want to mix cardio and strength training or stick to quick home workouts, GenAI can design a plan for you.\nExample prompt:\nI want to work out four days a week with a mix of cardio and strength training. Can you create a workout schedule for me? You should know I don't quite like going to the gym, so a home routine I can do right after my workday is over would be best. Also, I have a yoga mat, resistance bands, and some light dumbbells. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Small Win: You now have a structured workout plan that fits your goals and lifestyle, without the hassle of doing all the research yourself.\n3. Daily Journal Prompts \u0026amp; Reflection Journaling is one of those habits that sounds simple but can be hard to keep up with. I even have started journaling about 5 times in the last 3 years. Needless to say, all were unsuccessful. When it comes to writing daily I usually have the same questions in my mind: \u0026ldquo;What do I write about? How do I get started?\u0026rdquo; GenAI can offer personalized journal prompts that help us reflect on our day or work through our goals.\nHow it works: GenAI can provide daily prompts or questions tailored to whatever you’re working on—personal growth, goal setting, or even just unwinding after a long day.\nExample prompt:\nGive me a question to help me reflect on my journal today. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Small Win: Instead of staring at a blank page, you get thoughtful questions that help you dive into meaningful reflection. It’s like having your own personal journal buddy to help you stay consistent.\nPro Tip: Remind your GenAI Buddy What You Did Earlier Once you get started with automating your daily tasks for small wins, you can always add an extra sentence at the end of your prompt reminding your GenAI buddy of the outcome of the previous interaction. For instance:\n\u0026ldquo;Can you help me plan healthy dinners for the next 5 days, and also make a grocery list for me? You should know I already have some basics like eggs, milk, butter, and bread that I would like to finish this week. Here is the meal plan we crafted last week and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t want to repeat meals: [insert meal plan here].\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;I want to work out four days a week with a mix of cardio and strength training. Can you create a workout schedule for me? Remember that I don\u0026rsquo;t quite like going to the gym, so a home routine I can do right after my workday is over would be best. Also, I have a yoga mat, resistance bands, and some light dumbbells. Here is the schedule from last week so we build on top of it and not necessarily repeat the same things: [insert workout schedule here].\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Give me a question to help me reflect on my journal today. Here is the one from yesterday. I really enjoyed it, so we can keep building on that today: [insert journal prompt here].\u0026rdquo; Your Turn: Try it Out! What if yo started today? Pick one of the examples above—or any other—and give it a try with ChatGPT. Remember you can always set the role you want it to take and the tone you want it to use. You might be surprised at how much mental space you can save!\n","date":"October 14, 2024","hero":"/posts/gen_ai/week_03/article/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/gen_ai/week_03/article/","summary":"Explore how AI can help automate small, everyday tasks, from meal planning to workout scheduling, to free up your time for the things that matter.","tags":["Week 3","Generative AI","Productivity","Automation","Small Wins"],"title":"AI for Small Wins"},{"categories":["Technology","AI in Everyday Life","Self-Reflection"],"contents":" Image by DALL-E. ChatGPT as Your Life Coach Quite often I feel like I\u0026rsquo;m stuck in a loop, going over the same problems or decisions in my head over and over again. Has this happened to you too? Sometimes I feel like all I need is someone to hear my thoughts and help me ride all the emotions by asking the right questions. If you relate, I have great news for you. Yes, relying on a family member, friends, mentors, or even getting a life coach are great alternatives. The downside is that most likely you won\u0026rsquo;t have access to them 24/7 for as long as you want or need. That\u0026rsquo;s where tools like ChatGPT can come in handy—not to give us the answers but to guide our own reflections. It’s like having a personal coach to bounce your thoughts off of, anytime, anywhere—granted, given an internet connection.\nThe use case we\u0026rsquo;ll try out today turns GPT into a life coach that can help you reflect on challenges, personal goals, or even bigger life decisions. It’s not about finding the solution right away, but more about breaking things down, exploring your mindset, and figuring out what really matters to you. I\u0026rsquo;ll include the link to the full conversation if you want to get a better idea of how deep you can get, but for now here is a step-by-step summary.\nHow to Use Setting a Tone or Style with Generative AI Let’s introduce the tool of the week:\nSet a Tone or Style Like we explored on Monday, GenAI is like having a creative assistant who can help you organize ideas. It’s not about replacing your thought process but enhancing it. One way to get better results tailored to what you need or want is by giving the AI a specific tone or style for its responses. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to respond in a casual, friendly tone if you want your interaction to feel more relaxed, or you might prefer a more formal, structured tone when dealing with professional or sensitive topics.\nUse Case: ChatGPT as Your Personal Coach Step-by-Step: Using ChatGPT with a Specific Tone to Assist our Thought Process Step 1: Set the Scene — Define the Role and Tone First things first, you’ll want to give GPT a little context. You’re essentially asking it to play a role, and for this scenario, it’ll act as your compassionate life coach. Let it know what you’re dealing with or what area of your life you’re reflecting on:\nYou’re my life coach. You have a compassionate tone, but at the same time assertive. I feel stuck in my career right now and need help figuring out what’s holding me back. Can you help clarify my thoughts? Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT What happens next: By setting the role and the tone, you’re giving ChatGPT the context it needs to provide suggestions that more aligned with what you need in that moment.\nStep 2: Get Some Thoughtful Questions Here’s where the magic happens. GPT will respond with reflective, open-ended questions to help you dig deeper into what might be causing you to feel stuck.\nWhat ChatGPT might ask:\n\u0026ldquo;Do you feel like you\u0026rsquo;re learning and growing?\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Do you have a clear vision for your future?\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s kind of like having a friend who’s really good at asking those right questions—the ones that make you stop and think.\nStep 3: Reflect and Iterate Now, this part is where things get interesting. After ChatGPT asks you some thoughtful questions, you can start reflecting on your answers. Since it usually numbers the questions, I like responding with the same number sequence as it will be able to match a question with its answer. Then, it might ask follow-ups based on your responses, helping you uncover things you hadn’t considered before. You\u0026rsquo;ll be surprised how much clarity you can get from just having someone (or something) help you frame your own thoughts.\nStep 4: Make a Plan Once you’ve done some reflection and feel like you’ve got a better grip on what’s going on, ask ChatGPT to help you make a plan. This is where the life-coach role really kicks in. It can help you outline actionable steps toward solving the issue or moving toward your goals. For example, you could try a prompt like this:\nI am quite interested in everything we have discussed so far. Please help me come up with a plan of actionable items I can work on each day next week. As we can see, by tweaking the tone, you can make your interaction with ChatGPT feel even more personal and aligned with your current needs.\nFinal Takeaways The power of this approach is that it turns reflection into a conversation. Sometimes we just need a sounding board to sort out our thoughts, and ChatGPT can play that role with the tone you have in mind. It’s not giving you a definitive solution, but it’s helping you uncover what’s already there—just waiting for the right nudge.\nHere is the link to the full conversation with ChatGPT!\nTry It Yourself! Set up a session with ChatGPT next time you\u0026rsquo;re stuck on something—whether it\u0026rsquo;s career decisions, personal growth, or just figuring out how to unwind after a busy week. Let it be your reflective partner, and see where the conversation takes you.\nComing Up Next Week: We’ll explore \u0026ldquo;AI for Small Wins: Automate Simple Daily Tasks\u0026rdquo;.

Getting Started the Easy Way Have you ever wished you had an extra hand for those daily tasks that pile up? That’s where Generative AI (GenAI) can step in—not to take over, but to work with you, helping to bring your ideas to life and accelerate those small but important tasks. Today, we\u0026rsquo;re diving into two easy-to-use AI tools that act as a digital companion, enhancing your productivity, creativity, and daily routines. No expertise is required—just a willingness to explore!\nThe \u0026ldquo;Try It Out\u0026rdquo; Mindset Before we get into specific tools, let\u0026rsquo;s set the stage: Using AI is not about perfection; it\u0026rsquo;s about experimentation. Think of these tools as your digital buddies—they’re here to offer suggestions, provide a jump-start, and help refine your thoughts. And just like a friend giving you advice, it’s up to you to decide what works and what to tweak. So, let’s dive in with the mindset of trying things out and exploring what fits!\nEveryday AI: Your Helpful Sidekick Imagine having a digital companion that can help you learn something new, brainstorm ideas, or plan out your week. AI tools can assist in all these areas and more, providing that extra nudge to get you started or helping you polish up what you\u0026rsquo;ve already created. Below are a few beginner-friendly AI tools that can support you in various daily activities. Let\u0026rsquo;s walk through what they do, how they can help, and some simple steps to get you started.\n1. ChatGPT – Your Conversational Companion Overview: ChatGPT is like having a creative assistant who can help you organize thoughts, write emails, brainstorm ideas, or even answer questions you might have. It’s not about replacing your input but enhancing it. For example, if you’re stuck on learning a new concept, ChatGPT can provide more information, leaving it to you to decide how deep you want to get into it.\nAccount: It is not necessary to go for the Pro account, especially if you are beginning your journey. Their current free version is still very impressive anyway. Privacy Note: If privacy is something that concerns you, OpenAI allows you to disable ChatGPT\u0026rsquo;s memory in their personalization settings and even have \u0026ldquo;temporary chats\u0026rdquo; by clicking on the top-left corner where the model name is and toggling the \u0026ldquo;Temporary chat\u0026rdquo; option.\nSome Use Cases: ChatGPT can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as drafting emails, creating to-do lists, brainstorming ideas, and even providing thoughtful responses to more complex questions. Here are some specific scenarios to show its versatility:\nWriting Assistance: ChatGPT can be your personal editor. It can help you organize your writing, make sure you are not missing any important piece of information, or even translate it into most languages. You can use different tools—like the one we discussed last Thursday—as well. Try setting a role for it to play and prompt it with: I've been working on something and I would like your assistance. Take the role of the editor for the New York Times as this is an editorial piece I'm working on. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Idea Refinement: ChatGPT can help you structure the thoughts or opinions you have on any subject. You can stress-test your ideas and it will help you lay them out in a comprehensible and structured way. Try to prompt it with the following: I want to stress-test an idea I've been having for a while. Can you help me with that? Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Brainstorming: ChatGPT can help you brainstorm topics. It’ll offer a variety of angles, which you can then refine or combine. Try out: I'm hosting a games night with some friends. Can you help me with that? I want to plan some games outside of the common mainstream ones. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT Planning: ChatGPT can help you suggesting a structured plan based on your needs and asks. For instance, try asking: I am currently working on multiple projects and have some deliverables due this week. Can you help me organize the to-do's for each of them and prioritize them? You should know, I'm not so good at context-switching, so it would be ideal for me to finish one deliverable at a time. However, given that some tasks have some idle time, I could work on something similar meanwhile. Copy the prompt and try it with ChatGPT 2. Grammarly – Your Writing Assistant Overview: Grammarly helps you polish your writing by suggesting changes to grammar, tone, and clarity. Think of it as having an editor by your side, making sure your message comes across the way you intend. It’s not limited to just one platform—you can use Grammarly across various devices and applications, making it a versatile tool for everyday tasks. Use Cases: Proofreading emails, refining social media posts, editing documents, and even checking for tone in messaging apps. Quick Start: Copy and paste an email draft into Grammarly, and watch as it makes suggestions like “Consider changing this word to make your tone more friendly.” You’re still in control of the final message, choosing which suggestions to accept. Extended Capabilities: Using Grammarly Across Platforms Chrome Extension: Grammarly integrates directly into your browser so you can use it seamlessly on various websites. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re typing out a LinkedIn post, drafting an email in Gmail, or writing a blog post, Grammarly’s real-time suggestions appear directly as you type, ensuring clarity and correctness on the go. Windows and Mac Integrations: Grammarly offers a native Desktop app that can be used across multiple applications. This means you can enjoy Grammarly’s writing suggestions in your word processing software without the need to copy and paste text back and forth. Android and iPhone Keyboards: Grammarly also provides a smartphone keyboard that integrates with your device’s operating system, so you can get writing support directly within apps like WhatsApp, social media platforms, or note-taking apps, ensuring clear and polished communication, even when you’re on the move. Wrapping It Up: AI as Your Everyday Companion These are the two AI tools that I use everyday, but remember: they are meant to assist, not take over. Think of them as digital companions that help you get started, refine ideas, and simplify small tasks. The magic happens when you engage with them, guiding their outputs to fit your needs. So, why not give one of these tools a try today?\nYour Turn: Start Exploring!

Before We Start Welcome to our first hands-on guide! Today, we\u0026rsquo;re building on Monday\u0026rsquo;s discussion by exploring how to use Generative AI for better, more informed decision-making. Whether you’re feeling overwhelmed by choices or simply unsure where to start, AI can be the thinking partner you need.\nThe Structure of These Thursday Guides Just like we discussed in Monday\u0026rsquo;s article, exploring GenAI is all about finding new ways to integrate it into your daily life. Each Thursday, we\u0026rsquo;ll tackle a real-world problem that GenAI can help you solve, using practical examples and hands-on prompts. Here\u0026rsquo;s how these guides are structured:\nDefine the Problem \u0026amp; Why GenAI Can Solve It: We’ll identify a common challenge and explain how AI can act as your ideal partner in overcoming it. Present the LLM-Prompting Tool of the Week: Learn a specific tool or method to enhance your AI interactions. This week, it\u0026rsquo;s all about role-playing scenarios for personalized recommendations. Walk Through the Use Case: We’ll dive into an actionable, real-world example that shows you how to implement this tool with Generative AI. Unlocking AI for Daily Decisions: A Game-Changing Tool How Generative AI Can Help with Unknowns and Decision Fatigue Sometimes, the biggest challenge in decision-making isn’t the choices themselves—it’s the unknowns. We often don’t even know what options exist because we lack the right information, perspective, or simply haven’t been exposed to certain ideas. This can leave us feeling stuck, unsure of where to start or what questions to ask. It’s like standing in front of a vast, uncharted landscape with no map, knowing there are hidden gems out there but not knowing which direction to explore. The fear of missing out on better options or making the \u0026ldquo;wrong\u0026rdquo; choice can be paralyzing, turning what should be an exciting process of discovery into a frustrating experience.\nOn top of that, the mental exhaustion from constant decision-making—known as decision fatigue—can lead us to settle for familiar, less satisfying choices simply because it feels easier than exploring the unknown. When our mental resources are drained, we become more inclined to stick with the status quo, opting for what’s comfortable rather than what might be truly fulfilling. This can limit our experiences and personal growth, as we miss out on opportunities to discover new interests, ideas, or solutions that lie just beyond our immediate reach.\nEnter Generative AI. Remember when we talked about how GenAI can be like a thinking buddy? By using AI as a guide to help us explore new possibilities and uncover relevant information, we can make more informed choices. Whether it’s finding your next great read, learning a new skill, or exploring an unfamiliar topic, AI provides a way to illuminate paths we might not have considered. Along the way, it also eases decision fatigue by offering thoughtful suggestions tailored to our evolving needs.\nHow to Use Role-Playing Scenarios in Generative AI for Better Decision-Making Now, let’s introduce the tool of the week:\nRole-Play Scenarios Like we explored on Monday, GenAI isn’t just about spitting out information; it’s about interacting in ways that feel personal and relevant. One way to do this is by giving the AI a specific role to play. This week, we\u0026rsquo;re turning ChatGPT into a well-read mentor—the kind who understands different genres and wants to get to know your preferences to make the best recommendation possible.\nBy setting this role, we make the AI’s responses more tailored and nuanced, allowing it to go beyond generic suggestions to something that resonates with you personally.\nUse Case: Finding Which Book to Read Next with ChatGPT as Your Guide Let’s look at a simple yet surprisingly tricky decision: picking your next book. Maybe you’re in the mood for something uplifting, a mystery, or even a thought-provoking biography, but don\u0026rsquo;t have quite an idea where to start. Here’s how ChatGPT, playing the role of your literary mentor, can guide you through the process.\nStep-by-Step: Using ChatGPT in a Role-Play Scenario Step 1: Set the Role Just like in real life, it helps to start by setting the scene. Here\u0026rsquo;s one way to tell ChatGPT who it\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be:\nYou are a well-read mentor with a deep knowledge of books across genres. I’m looking for a book recommendation based on my current mood and preferences. Feel free to copy the prompt above and try it with ChatGPT What happens next: By setting this role, you’re giving ChatGPT the context it needs to provide suggestions that feel more like they\u0026rsquo;re coming from an experienced guide. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a friend who just \u0026ldquo;gets\u0026rdquo; your taste in books.\nStep 2: Explore Initial Recommendations ChatGPT will then ask you about specific genres, themes, or types of stories that you’re interested in. Think of this as the AI getting to know you. Based on this information, it will provide its first set of recommendations. Review these suggestions to see how they align with your current mood or curiosity. And if they\u0026rsquo;re not quite right? No worries—this is just the beginning of the process.\nStep 3: Refine the Recommendations with Iteration Just like we mentioned in Monday\u0026rsquo;s article, using GenAI effectively is about exploration and iteration. After the initial suggestions, use follow-up prompts to refine your search:\nI have read Sapiens before actually. I enjoyed it very much. But you know what, now that I think about it, some friends always talk about Oprah's Book Club list as well as Adam Grant's book recommendations. Let's reduce the scope to those By iterating this way, ChatGPT, still playing the role of your well-read mentor, will dive deeper into what aligns with your taste and needs. This process of refining responses is what makes GenAI feel like a true partner in decision-making.\nStep 4: Personalize Further Now let’s take it one step further. To really tailor the advice, you can provide even more context:\nActually, I am looking for a book I can read at night to unwind before going to bed. Would these options still apply, or do you think there is something better for this case? By giving this level of detail, you allow ChatGPT to fine-tune its recommendations, offering a personalized experience that addresses both your immediate needs and longer-term interests and can help you break through indecision or knowledge gaps.\nThe Power of Role-Playing: Making AI Your Personalized Advisor Like we talked about on Monday, GenAI isn\u0026rsquo;t a magic box—it’s a tool that works best when you engage with it. By setting a role for ChatGPT, you transform it from a simple assistant into a nuanced advisor, adapting to your needs with every interaction.\nWhether it’s choosing your next read, planning a new hobby, or brainstorming a project, using GenAI in a role-playing capacity can uncover possibilities you might never have considered. It’s all about exploring those uncharted territories in a way that feels both easy and insightful.\nFinal Takeaways The key takeaway? By giving ChatGPT a role to play, you can unlock a level of guidance and personalization that makes decision-making feel less like a chore and more like an enlightening conversation.\nTry It Yourself! Open ChatGPT and give it a role—whether it’s a mentor, a travel guide, or even a professional consultant. Start with a simple prompt and iterate on its responses until you find the insight or recommendation that resonates with you.\nAnd don’t miss next Monday’s article: \u0026ldquo;Exploring GenAI Tools: The Essentials to Get You Started.\u0026rdquo; We\u0026rsquo;ll dive into key tools to help you maximize your AI journey!\n","date":"October 3, 2024","hero":"/posts/gen_ai/week_01/tutorial/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/gen_ai/week_01/tutorial/","summary":"A hands-on guide to using Generative AI to make better decisions, focusing on role-play scenarios to tailor responses to individual needs.","tags":["Week 1","Generative AI","Artificial Intelligence","AI Journey","Exploration","Learning"],"title":"Hands-On: Using AI to Make Better and More Informed Choices"},{"categories":["Technology","AI in Everyday Life","Self-Improvement"],"contents":" Image by DALL-E. What Generative AI Is and Why It Matters Why Generative AI Matters to Everyday Life Imaging having the capacity to materialize any crazy idea you might have in a matter of minutes. That’s the promise of Generative AI (GenAI), a technology that is quickly weaving itself into the fabric of everyday life. Think about how computers revolutionized our world—today, almost every profession relies on some kind of computer system. GenAI is driving a similar change. Imagine trying to live your life without any form of computational power. What would that even look like? Just as computers and calculators handled the boring, repetitive tasks to free up our time for higher-order thinking, GenAI is now offering us new ways to bring our ideas to life.\nBut what exactly is it? In simple terms, Generative AI is like a creative partner that takes your input and turns it into something new—whether it’s text, images, or even music. It\u0026rsquo;s like having an assistant who not only helps you brainstorm but also executes your vision in ways that were once unthinkable.\nSetting Realistic Expectations: GenAI Isn’t a Magic Box However, let\u0026rsquo;s be clear: GenAI isn’t a magic box that delivers ready-to-ship products with the push of a button. Think of it like the grammar or spell check on your computer—it helps you refine and question your work, but you are the final gatekeeper. It\u0026rsquo;s up to you to ensure that the end result is true, factual, and aligned with your intentions.\nUsing GenAI effectively is less about \u0026ldquo;mastering\u0026rdquo; it and more about learning to discern what works and what doesn’t. It\u0026rsquo;s about judging its output, sifting through results, and guiding it back when it strays. This is where the real skill lies.\nAccessibility and the Human-Like Qualities of GenAI The real beauty of GenAI lies in its accessibility. Think of the most intelligent person you know—now imagine combining that with the kindness of a friend who is always willing to help and the wisdom of a mentor who wants to make you better. That’s GenAI, in a nutshell. Sure, it has its quirks and misconceptions at times, just like any of us. But it\u0026rsquo;s always available, ready to assist you, whether you\u0026rsquo;re brainstorming ideas, drafting an email, or exploring a new hobby.\nHere’s a quick example: Let’s say you’re planning a family vacation but feeling overwhelmed with all the details. With just a simple prompt, GenAI can help generate a full itinerary, complete with travel suggestions, accommodation options, and activity ideas based on your preferences. You can then review and tweak this itinerary to fit your exact needs. It\u0026rsquo;s like having a travel planner at your fingertips, giving you a head start so you can focus on enjoying the trip rather than stressing over the details.\nWhy Mastery Is Not the Goal You can’t \u0026ldquo;master\u0026rdquo; GenAI in the traditional sense. It’s not a game with a final level; there’s no ultimate \u0026ldquo;finished\u0026rdquo; state. GenAI evolves, and its responses are not set in stone. This journey is about exploring what\u0026rsquo;s possible, then playing around with different ways GenAI can fit into our lives. Over time, you’ll naturally start to understand its capabilities and how to leverage them to meet your goals.\nThink of it like learning to use Google in its early days. Remember when we hesitated to adopt search engines? Now, they’re second nature. Using GenAI effectively means experimenting, making mistakes, and gradually finding the best ways it can support you.\nEmbracing the AI Journey This journey is about becoming comfortable using GenAI, just as we learned to rely on Google to find information. By consciously choosing to embrace GenAI now, we avoid the slow transition that happened with earlier technologies and we position ourselves to take full advantage of what it offers. The key is to explore and discover, not to aim for perfection.\nLooking Forward: Exploring Nuanced Use Cases As we go forward, this series will explore how GenAI can become a part of your daily toolkit. We\u0026rsquo;ll dive into different use cases, practical tips, and strategies for embracing this tool in a way that feels easy and accessible.\nOn Mondays, the focus will be on long-form articles that delve into comprehensive topics around Generative AI, providing detailed insights and exploration. In contrast, Thursdays will feature hands-on, walk-through posts that present practical use cases and guides. By the end of this journey, you’ll realize that while leveraging GenAI doesn’t require you to be a rocket scientist, it also goes beyond simply using it for basic tasks.\nTogether, we’ll explore how to discover nuanced ways to bring your ideas to life, using GenAI as a powerful extension of your own creativity and problem-solving skills.\n","date":"September 30, 2024","hero":"/posts/gen_ai/week_01/article/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/gen_ai/week_01/article/","summary":"A beginner-friendly introduction to Generative AI, focusing on learning and exploration to integrate AI into daily life.","tags":["Week 1","Generative AI","Artificial Intelligence","AI Journey","Exploration","Learning"],"title":"Starting the AI Journey"},{"categories":null,"contents":" ","date":"September 30, 2024","hero":"/subscribe/hero.webp","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/subscribe/","summary":"\u003cscript\u003e\n    const sub_text = \"Subscribe\";\n    const send_text = \"Submit\";\n\u003c/script\u003e\n\n\u003cdiv class=\"subscribe-container\" style=\"display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center;\"\u003e\n    \u003cbutton id=\"subscribeBtn\" class=\"subscribe-btn\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #0891b2; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer;\" \u003e\n    \u003cscript\u003edocument.write(sub_text);\u003c/script\u003e\n    \u003c/button\u003e\n\n    \n    \u003cdiv id=\"subscribeBubble\" class=\"subscribe-bubble\" style=\"display: none; position: relative; padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px; z-index: 1000; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;\"\u003e\n        \u003cinput type=\"email\" id=\"emailInput\" placeholder=\"Enter your email\" style=\"margin-bottom: 10px; padding: 10px; width: 100%; max-width: 300px;\"\u003e\n        \u003cbutton id=\"submitEmail\" class=\"submit-btn\" style=\"padding: 10px 20px; background-color: #0891b2; color: white; border: none; border-radius: 5px; cursor: pointer;\" \u003e\n        \u003cscript\u003edocument.write(send_text);\u003c/script\u003e\n        \u003c/button\u003e\n    \u003c/div\u003e\n\u003c/div\u003e","tags":null,"title":"The GenAI Edge Newsletter"}]
