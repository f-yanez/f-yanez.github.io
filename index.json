(\u0026hellip;) Do, fail, learn. The rest will follow.\u0026quot; —Tony Fadell, Build\nOver the past decade, I\u0026rsquo;ve come to realize that my life has been a series of cycles: not knowing what I\u0026rsquo;m doing, choosing a reasonable next step, advancing as much as possible, noticing things aren\u0026rsquo;t entirely right, and starting again. The important aspect of these cycles is the presence of constants: my vision for my future and my values. These guiding principles help me evaluate options, seek advice, and make decisions.\nThe Intrigue of Learning The concept of learning is fascinating. There are numerous and diverse ways to learn—consuming content, self-reflection, vicarious experiences—yet they all produce the same outcome: a change in our mental state regarding a concept or experience, transitioning from unknown to known.\nExperiential Learning: The Key to Thriving As it turns out, there\u0026rsquo;s only so much learning we can achieve by consuming content, philosophizing, or learning through others\u0026rsquo; experiences. When we step out of our comfort zones—our homes, schools, or familiar environments—we immerse ourselves in countless unknown experiences. It\u0026rsquo;s this kind of learning (a.k.a. experiential learning) that we must excel at to truly thrive. By \u0026ldquo;excel,\u0026rdquo; I don\u0026rsquo;t mean knowing it all, but rather perfecting the art of \u0026ldquo;doing, failing, learning,\u0026rdquo; being resilient, and prepared to repeat the process over and over again.\nStaying True to Our Vision and Values In the midst of these cycles and the pursuit of experiential learning, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to stay true to our vision for the future and our values. These guiding forces serve as anchors, providing stability and direction as we navigate the inevitable uncertainties of life. By remaining true to our values and focused on our vision, we can make more informed decisions, align our actions with our goals, pivot any specific detail about our long-term plan that needs to be changed, and ultimately foster our personal growth.\nImage by storyset on Freepik.\n","date":"May 1, 2023","hero":"/posts/build/the_art_of_doing_failing_and_learning/hero.png","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/build/the_art_of_doing_failing_and_learning/","summary":"Navigating Life\u0026rsquo;s Cycles: Embracing Change and Learning \u0026ldquo;Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up continually until you learn how to screw up a little bit less.

This phrase reflected my approach to situations, where I focused on making the right decisions and believed that favorable outcomes would follow.\nHowever, after encountering another phrase recently, I realized that the saying I cherished lacked a complementary aspect. The phrase “do what oughts to be done” perfectly summarizes the thought process I actually had.\nAs a non-native English speaker, I sometimes notice nuances in language that might seem trivial to others. For instance, the auxiliary verb \u0026ldquo;ought\u0026rdquo; carries a sense of moral responsibility, unlike \u0026ldquo;have\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;should\u0026rdquo;, which respectively suggest breakable obligations and recommendations. This sense of moral responsibility helps eliminate the common question, \u0026ldquo;do I really have to?\u0026rdquo; and reassures me that, since it\u0026rsquo;s my responsibility to act in a certain way, there\u0026rsquo;s no other option than to follow through. By doing what needs to be done, I trust that tudo vai dar certo in the end.\nImage by pch.vector on Freepik.\n","date":"January 4, 2022","hero":"/posts/the_happiness_project/do_what_ought_to_be_done/hero.jpg","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/the_happiness_project/do_what_ought_to_be_done/","summary":"Trust that everything will work out in the end \u0026ldquo;I invoked my Tenth Commandment: ‘Do what ought to be done’.\u0026quot; —Gretchen Rubin, The Happiness Project\nIn December 2016, while volunteering in Curitiba, Brazil, I came across a saying that deeply resonated with me: “tudo vai dar certo”, which translates to “everything will turn out right”.

Nietzsche wrote, \u0026lsquo;All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n—Gretchen Rubin, The Happiness Project\nSince moving to Toronto, I\u0026rsquo;ve chosen biking as my preferred method of transportation. The benefits include a fair share of cardio, getting to places quickly, and the opportunity to listen to audiobooks or podcasts. However, the speed also means less time to make progress in my listening affairs. I\u0026rsquo;ve been considering whether walking is a better alternative, in other words, if the balance between travel time and time to read/listen should tilt towards the latter.\nNow, whether I bike or walk, there\u0026rsquo;s another trade-off: to listen or not to listen (a.k.a. think). In recent years, I\u0026rsquo;ve found that walking helps me see things clearly when solving problems or studying complex concepts—usually in the form of pacing while bouncing a small red ball. When not actively trying to solve something, I let my subconscious work on it before actively thinking about it again. Thus, during idle time (e.g., commuting, cleaning), I lean towards listening rather than active thinking. This favors knowledge acquisition over knowledge production. I plan to test Nietzsche\u0026rsquo;s hypothesis and try the opposite to see if it works for me. Knowing myself, I predict an 80/20 allocation of listening to active thinking would be ideal (Pareto, is that you?).\nImage by johnstocker on Freepik.\n","date":"January 3, 2022","hero":"/posts/the_happiness_project/knowledge_acquisition_vs_knowledge_production/hero.png","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/the_happiness_project/knowledge_acquisition_vs_knowledge_production/","summary":"How should I spend my idle time? \u0026ldquo;Walking had an added benefit: it helped me to think.

I\u0026rsquo;m usually the odd one out—the one who doesn\u0026rsquo;t get hot chocolate at a Christmas market because it doesn\u0026rsquo;t bring the same joy as my mom\u0026rsquo;s, or the one who stays quiet for hours at gatherings because I prefer discussing ideas and concepts rather than people. However, I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to embrace this uniqueness instead of running away from it.\nOver time, I\u0026rsquo;ve realized that just because something is considered the status quo or the modus operandi for the majority, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean it\u0026rsquo;s right for me, and that\u0026rsquo;s okay. I\u0026rsquo;ve learned to follow my desires, even if they\u0026rsquo;re unconventional, because they bring me happiness and personal growth. There is a constant trade-off between choosing what\u0026rsquo;s best for you and going against the flow of those around you. Luckily, I\u0026rsquo;m surrounded by people who understand and appreciate my quirks and sincerity, even with its touch of awkwardness.\nWe are all different, with our unique thoughts, ideas, likes, dislikes, and preferences. Not everyone is comfortable with the introspection needed to discover their true desires. It\u0026rsquo;s easier to go with the flow and follow the preferences dictated by one\u0026rsquo;s social circle. However, stepping out of that comfort zone has brought me real peace of mind and happiness. We are all different, and our differences are what others describe as weird—but in a good way.\nImage by rawpixel.com on Freepik.\n","date":"January 2, 2022","hero":"/posts/the_happiness_project/being_the_odd_one_out/hero.png","permalink":"https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/the_happiness_project/being_the_odd_one_out/","summary":"Be weird, in a good way \u0026ldquo;My sister said, ‘I don’t think you realize just how weird you are—but,’ she added hastily, ‘in a good way\u0026rsquo;.\u0026quot; —Gretchen Rubin, The Happiness Project\nI often reflect on a particular phrase that captures my feelings of being different in a casual yet effective way.
