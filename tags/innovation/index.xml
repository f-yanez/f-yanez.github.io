&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;A company that’s likely to make a substantial change in the status quo &amp;hellip; is thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you’ve never heard before, but which makes perfect sense once you hear it.&amp;quot;&lt;p>

&lt;p>Ideation is a muscle that we must train, similar to how we exercise our bodies to become stronger and healthier. Good ideas don&amp;rsquo;t simply come out of the blue or happen by chance. They are a result of consistent effort and practice. By generating multiple ideas and discerning whether they are good or bad, we can identify the necessary features for successful ideas and refine our ideation skills. This continuous exercise helps us build a strong foundation for innovation and creativity, enabling us to tackle challenges, seize opportunities with confidence, and frame solutions to problems in creative ways.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
