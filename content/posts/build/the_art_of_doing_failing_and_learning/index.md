### Navigating Life's Cycles: Embracing Change and Learning

> "Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up continually until you learn how to screw up a little bit less. (...) Do, fail, learn. The rest will follow."<p>
> â€”**Tony Fadell**, [Build](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59696349-build)


Over the past decade, I've come to realize that my life has been a series of cycles: not knowing what I'm doing, choosing a reasonable next step, advancing as much as possible, noticing things aren't entirely right, and starting again. The important aspect of these cycles is the presence of constants: my vision for my future and my values. These guiding principles help me evaluate options, seek advice, and make decisions.

#### The Intrigue of Learning

The concept of *learning* is fascinating. There are numerous and diverse ways to learnâ€”consuming content, self-reflection, vicarious experiencesâ€”yet they all produce the same outcome: a change in our mental state regarding a concept or experience, transitioning from unknown to known.

#### Experiential Learning: The Key to Thriving

As it turns out, there's only so much learning we can achieve by consuming content, philosophizing, or learning through others' experiences. When we step out of our comfort zonesâ€”our homes, schools, or familiar environmentsâ€”we immerse ourselves in countless unknown experiences. It's this kind of learning (a.k.a. experiential learning) that we must excel at to truly thrive. By "excel," I don't mean knowing it all, but rather perfecting the art of "doing, failing, learning," being resilient, and prepared to repeat the process over and over again.

#### Staying True to Our Vision and Values
In the midst of these cycles and the pursuit of experiential learning, it's crucial to stay true to our vision for the future and our values. These guiding forces serve as anchors, providing stability and direction as we navigate the inevitable uncertainties of life. By remaining true to our values and focused on our vision, we can make more informed decisions, align our actions with our goals, pivot any specific detail about our long-term plan that needs to be changed, and ultimately foster our personal growth.
