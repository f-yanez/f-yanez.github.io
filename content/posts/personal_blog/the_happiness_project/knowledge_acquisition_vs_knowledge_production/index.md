### How should I spend my idle time?

> "Walking had an added benefit: it helped me to think. Nietzsche wrote, **'All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.'**"

Since moving to Toronto, I've chosen biking as my preferred mode of transportation. For me, it offers a great cardio workout, gets me places quickly, and allows me to listen to audiobooks or podcasts. On the downside, because it's so fast, there's hardly enough time to make much progress on my listening. This makes me wonder: would walking be a better alternative? In other words, should I prioritize the longer time spent listening over the speed of getting somewhere?

Whether I bike or walk, there's another trade-off: to listen or not to listen—that is the question. In the past few years, I've realized that when I'm solving a problem or learning something complex, walking often helps clear my thoughts. This usually involves pacing around while bouncing a small soft ball. When I'm not actively working on a problem, I let my subconscious process it before I revisit it consciously. So, when it comes to idle time (e.g., commuting, cleaning), I usually prefer listening to audiobooks or podcasts rather than active thinking. Still, I end up favoring knowledge acquisition over knowledge production during those times.

I think it's worth testing Nietzsche’s hypothesis and trying the opposite to see if it works for me. Knowing myself, though, I predict that an 80/20 split of listening versus active thinking might be the ideal balance (Pareto, is that you?).
