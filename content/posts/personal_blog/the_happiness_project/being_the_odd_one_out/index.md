## Be Weird, In a Good Way

> "My sister said, ‘I don’t think you realize just how weird you are—but,’ she added hastily, ‘in a good way'."<p>
> —**Gretchen Rubin**, [_The Happiness Project_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6398634-the-happiness-project)

I often think about this quote, and I believe it captures the sentiment quite well—both casually and affectionately. I usually feel like the odd one out—the person who skips the hot chocolate at a Christmas market because I know it won't bring me as much joy as my mom's. I’m the one who can stay quiet for a long time at a gathering, preferring conversations about ideas and concepts over small talk about people not present. This sense of being different is something I’ve learned to embrace rather than avoid.

Over time, I've realized that just because something is the norm or the "modus operandi" for most people doesn't mean it's right for me, and that's perfectly fine. I've learned that I can choose to follow my own desires, even if they're unconventional, as long as they bring me happiness and growth. However, there’s always a trade-off: choosing what's best for you can sometimes mean going against the expectations of those you care about. Particularly, I consider myself fortunate to be surrounded by people who have learned to understand my quirks and, to some extent, appreciate my sincerity with all its awkwardness.

I believe we are all unique. Each of us is an accumulation of thoughts, ideas, likes, dislikes, and preferences. Yet, not everyone feels comfortable with the introspection required to uncover what they truly want. It's easier to drift along in the river of general preferences dictated by the herd. However, stepping out of that comfort zone has given me real peace of mind and the happiness that comes with it. We are all different, and those differences are what others often describe as "_weird—but in a good way_."
