### How to Provide Contextual Information with Generative AI

Let’s introduce the tool of the week:

{{< mark >}}Providing Contextual Information{{< /mark >}}

A pro tip to make your interactions more effective: use **Contextual Information** in your prompts. By giving the AI some background, you’ll get results that are way more tailored to what you need. For example, you might say:  


{{< copyable >}}  
We are a design agency. We just had a meeting was about a weekly project status update. Key team members involved: Sarah (lead designer), John (project manager), and Mary (client liaison).
{{< /copyable >}}  


<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p> 


By providing more context, you’re helping the AI understand the specifics of your situation and give better, more relevant results.

### Why Small Wins with AI Matter  

Sometimes we think of AI as this big, complicated thing that solves major problems—but I’m here to tell you, it’s also the perfect sidekick for those small, everyday wins. Automating these repetitive, tedious tasks means you’re freeing up mental space for things that really matter. Whether it's work-related or personal stuff, AI helps streamline it all.

### Step-by-Step: Simple Workflow Automation  

Let’s walk through how you can use GenAI for automating some small but essential tasks after your meetings, from creating notes to updating stakeholders.  

#### Step 1: **Summarize Meeting Notes**  

First things first—after a meeting, you'll need to capture key points and decisions. With AI, instead of manually writing these notes, you can input a prompt that helps generate them for you. Here's how to set it up:


{{< copyable >}}  
I need to summarize our team meeting from today. We discussed three key projects and made decisions regarding next steps. Can you help me create a summary that I can share with the team?

[_Insert meeting's transcripts here_]. 
{{< /copyable >}}  


<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>  

This will give you a clean, concise recap of the meeting that you can quickly share internally. No more fumbling around trying to remember the details!

#### Step 2: **Turn Notes into Action Items**  

Next up, turn those meeting notes into a clear list of action items for your team. This step is crucial for keeping everyone accountable and ensuring the follow-ups are clear. AI can easily help you break down the discussion points into actionable steps:


{{< copyable >}}  
Based on the meeting summary, help me create a list of action items. Make sure to specify who is responsible for each task and the deadlines we agreed on.  
{{< /copyable >}}  


<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>  

This step ensures that your team knows what they need to focus on—and it keeps everyone on track without you manually writing everything out.

#### Step 3: **Create Automated Update Emails for External Stakeholders**  

Finally, if your meeting involved decisions that affect external stakeholders (clients, partners, etc.), you’ll need to send them updates. Instead of drafting these emails from scratch, let AI do the heavy lifting. Here's how you can use a simple prompt:  


{{< copyable >}}  
I need to send an update to our marketing agency about the changes we agreed on during today’s meeting. We decided to increase the ad spend by 15% and update the creatives. Could you draft an email for me?  
{{< /copyable >}}  


<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>  

With this, you'll get a ready-to-send email that you can personalize if needed.

## Final Takeaways  

Small tasks like meeting notes, action items, and follow-up emails can be time-consuming—but they don’t have to be. AI is perfect for these small wins, letting you automate workflows and reclaim more of your time. Remember to use context when prompting, so the AI can better assist you.
