## Using GenAI to Master the Lean Methodology

In [Monday's article](/posts/gen_ai/week_09/article/), we explored how businesses use GenAI for marketing, support, and innovation. Today, we'll delve into a hands-on example: applying Lean Methodology to your business with the help of your ***Thinking Buddy***. Lean Methodology emphasizes learning through iteration, testing assumptions, and ensuring your business decisions align with customer needs. With GenAI, you can accelerate this process, uncover insights, and refine ideas systematically.

This guide demonstrates how to integrate GenAI into critical Lean Methodology steps, such as defining assumptions, testing hypotheses, and refining business strategies. Today's use case will focus on a small clothing line business, but these steps can be applied to any business, whether it is still in the ideation stage or already established.

### The Tool of the Week: Sequential Questioning

Our featured tool this week is:
{{< mark >}}Sequential Questioning{{< /mark >}}

Breaking a complex task into smaller, sequential prompts helps you gather detailed and actionable insights from GenAI. Instead of asking a broad question, guide your ***Thinking Buddy*** step-by-step through the problem, ensuring it fully understands your needs.

**Why This Helps**: Sequential questioning ensures clarity, avoids overwhelming the AI with too much information, and creates more focused and tailored outputs.

### Step-by-Step: Applying Lean Methodology with GenAI

---

### Step 1: Learn the Lean Methodology

Lean Methodology revolves around key principles such as **eliminating waste**, **delivering customer value**, and **iterating quickly through the Build-Measure-Learn cycle**. Before applying these concepts, it's crucial to understand their theoretical foundation.

- **How GenAI Helps**: Use GenAI to act as your teacher, explaining *Lean* concepts in simple terms, identifying core principles, and relating them to any business.
- **What You'll Achieve**: A foundational understanding of Lean Methodology that you can later tailor to your specific business.

**_Prompt to Try:_**

</p>

**What to Dig Deeper Into with *Sequential Questioning***:
- **Defining Assumptions**: Ask your *Thinking Buddy* to explain how to identify key assumptions about your clothing line customers' preferences (e.g., styles, price points).
- **Innovation Accounting**: Then, keep asking questions to learn how to set measurable objectives for validating those assumptions (e.g., tracking conversion rates for new designs).

### Step 2: Identify Current Challenges in the Clothing Line

With a theoretical understanding of Lean Methodology, the next step is to evaluate your business's current operations. Common challenges might include inventory mismanagement, a mismatch between customer needs and product offerings, or inefficient production cycles.

- **How GenAI Helps**: Use GenAI to analyze your business by guiding it with prompts that highlight your goals, audience, and operational details. Your ***Thinking Buddy*** can help surface pain points you might not have noticed.
- **What You'll Achieve**: A clearer picture of inefficiencies and areas for improvement in your business.

**_Prompt to Try:_**
{{< copyable >}}
I run a small clothing line. Ask me questions about my operations, inventory, and customer base to identify inefficiencies or areas where we might not be delivering value.

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>
</p>

**What to Dig Deeper Into with *Sequential Questioning***:
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Request help in identifying root causes for inefficiencies (e.g., overstocking due to inaccurate demand forecasting).
- **Customer Personas**: Have your ***Thinking Buddy*** assist in refining customer personas based on the identified challenges.

---

### Step 3: Design a Lean Experiment

The Build-Measure-Learn cycle is at the heart of Lean Methodology. Here, you create a small experiment to test assumptions, gather data, and iterate based on findings. For a clothing line, this might involve introducing a single new product, testing a marketing approach, or changing a supply chain process.

- **How GenAI Helps**: Use GenAI to design a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and outline a strategy for testing it effectively.
- **What You'll Achieve**: A detailed experiment plan to validate assumptions with minimal resource expenditure.

**_Prompt to Try:_**

</p>

**What to Dig Deeper Into with *Sequential Questioning***:
- **Metrics for Success**: Ask your ***Thinking Buddy*** to define clear metrics for evaluating the MVP's performance (e.g., pre-orders, social media engagement).
- **Scaling Up**: Explore how successful elements of the experiment can be scaled across your business.

### Step 4: Build an Innovation Accounting Framework
Innovation accounting tracks progress using metrics that emphasize learning and adaptability rather than just output or sales. It's essential for measuring how effectively your business is evolving to meet customer needs.

- **How GenAI Helps**: GenAI can assist in identifying key learning metrics, such as prototype iteration rates, customer satisfaction scores, or A/B test outcomes. It also helps translate abstract goals into measurable targets.
- **What You'll Achieve**: A clear framework for assessing progress and ensuring your experiments align with long-term business goals.

**_Prompt to Try:_**
{{< copyable >}}
Help me create an innovation accounting framework for my clothing line. Focus on learning metrics instead of vanity metrics (as defined by the Lean Methodology).

**What to Dig Deeper Into with *Sequential Questioning***:
- **Setting Benchmarks**: Ask your ***Thinking Buddy*** for realistic targets for each metric. For example, “What's a reasonable customer satisfaction score to aim for during the initial prototype phase?”
- **Tracking Tools**: Explore which software or methods can best track your chosen metrics in real-time, enhancing efficiency and accuracy.

---

### Step 5: Measure Results and Iterate

The next step involves analyzing the results of your Lean experiment and making iterative improvements. Use customer feedback, sales data, and observations to refine your approach.

- **How GenAI Helps**: Your ***Thinking Buddy*** can assist in organizing and interpreting data from your experiment, helping you spot trends and prioritize next steps.
- **What You'll Achieve**: Actionable insights for improving your business based on real data.

### Step 6: Apply Lean Beyond the Experiment

Lean Methodology isn't just for isolated experiments—it's a mindset that can permeate every aspect of your business. For example, it can optimize production processes, streamline marketing efforts, or improve customer service interactions.

- **How GenAI Helps**: Ask GenAI to suggest other areas in your business where Lean principles can make an impact.
- **What You'll Achieve**: A long-term strategy for embedding Lean thinking into your operations.
