Sometimes, we don't know where to start about presenting information upfront in our prompts. Instead, we ca prompt our ***Thinking Buddy*** to engage in conversation by instructing it something along the lines of: “Ask me questions about this topic.” This approach ensures the AI gathers necessary context, promoting richer, more focused dialogue.

### Step-by-Step: Defining Your Mission, Vision, and Success

### Step 1: Define Your Core Values

Start by identifying the values that guide your life and decision-making. Your _**Thinking Buddy**_ can help you articulate these values by prompting reflective questions.

**Example Questions from GenAI**:
- “What moments have made you feel most fulfilled and why?”
- “What qualities do you admire in people around you?”

**Why This Helps**: By answering these questions, you can pinpoint the values that matter most to you, laying the foundation for your mission and vision.

### Step 2: Craft Your Personal Mission Statement

Once your core values are clear, you can use them to build your mission statement. This statement should focus on what you do, who you serve, and how you approach your life and work.

Based on my identified core values, guide me to create a personal mission statement. Ask follow-up questions if more details are needed.
