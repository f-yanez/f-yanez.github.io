When we think of GenAI, productivity or creativity often comes to mind. But beyond these functions, GenAI can be a powerful partner in self-exploration.

### 1. Defining Core Values and Virtues

Core values shape our decisions and define who we are. But have you ever taken the time to write them down? Throughout history, influential figures like Benjamin Franklin reflected on specific virtues they wanted to embody. This practice made them more intentional and mindful in their daily lives. With GenAI as your ***Thinking Buddy***, you can engage in this same exercise. Use it to brainstorm and refine the values that guide you, helping you articulate what you want to practice and be known for.


**Prompt to Try**:
{{< copyable >}}
Do you know Benjamin Franklin's 13 virtues? First, tell me more about that. Then, help me reflect on my core values and virtues. Ask questions that guide me to identify what I truly value in life and why.

### 2. Creating a Personal Mission and Vision Statement and a Strategy to Get There

A clear mission and vision can be transformative, giving your life direction and purpose. Just as prominent leaders like Gandhi and Nelson Mandela align their actions with their values, you too can gain focus by defining your mission. GenAI can assist by asking targeted questions that help you articulate your long-term aspirations. This reflective work helps with aligning your daily actions with your greater purpose, turning abstract goals into actionable strategies. You can also rely on your ***Thinking Buddy*** to build a comprehensive roadmap to achieve your mission: from setting specific objectives to identifying milestone checkpoints, it can help lay out steps that adapt as you evolve.

**Prompt to Try**:
{{< copyable >}}
Help me draft a personal mission and vision statement that aligns with my goals. I want to be able to define a strategy that gets me there, but that is flexible enough that will let me accomodate all the different oportunities that might come along the way.

### 3. Challenging Personal Assumptions and Biases

We all carry biases that impact our actions and perspectives. Often, these biases go unnoticed unless we actively reflect on them. GenAI can act as a prompt generator, offering questions that encourage deep introspection to uncover hidden assumptions. This process can lead to more thoughtful decisions and a balanced view of the world, helping you approach life with a higher awareness.

**Prompt to Try**:
{{< copyable >}}
I am about to start a new role as *[insert role here]*. I want to make sure I'm not bringing unconscious biases or assumptions into this role. Help me dig deeper to assess whether I am missing something I should take care of so I can do a better job.

**Insight**: By framing thought-provoking questions, your ***Thinking Buddy*** fosters a space to examine and challenge your perspectives, leading to personal growth and deeper understanding.

### 4. Exploring Deep, Hypothetical Conversations

Engaging in deep, hypothetical conversations can unlock new ways of thinking and problem-solving. GenAI can help facilitate these dialogues, offering prompts that push you to explore complex, “what if” scenarios and navigate moral or strategic dilemmas. This type of reflection can reveal new insights about your beliefs and thought processes, making your decision-making sharper and more informed.

**Prompt to Try**:
{{< copyable >}}
Engage me in a conversation about "my definition of success" and how it aligns with my current life goals.
