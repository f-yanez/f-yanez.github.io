## Collaborating with GenAI for Creative Projects

In [Monday’s article](/posts/gen_ai/week_08/article/), we explored how GenAI can act as a ***Thinking Buddy*** in your creative endeavors. Today, we’ll dive into a practical example: creating a presentation with GenAI. Whether you’re working on a professional deck or a school project, this hands-on guide will show how GenAI can help brainstorm ideas, organize content, and polish the final result—all while keeping your unique vision at the forefront.

### The Tool of the Week: Provide Examples for Replication  

This week’s featured tool emphasizes setting clear patterns:  
{{< mark >}}Provide Examples for Replication{{< /mark >}}  

When asking your ***Thinking Buddy*** to assist with a task—such as drafting slides or writing an email—include a specific example of what you’re looking for. By showing a clear format or tone to replicate, you guide the AI toward producing responses that align with your expectations.  

**Why This Helps**: Examples act as templates, ensuring the AI understands the structure, style, and level of detail you need. This results in output that’s not only accurate but also tailored to your unique project.  

**Pro Tip:** Use a _tag_ to refer back to extra pieces of information in your instructions. For instance:

{{< copyable >}}
I want you to use this previous [SUMMARY] I worked on so you keep the same structure, tone, and language.

### Step-by-Step: Drafting a Presentation with GenAI  

#### Step 1: Start with Notes and Brainstorming  

Creating a presentation starts with gathering your thoughts. Share your initial ideas or rough notes with GenAI to transform scattered points into a coherent structure.  

{{< copyable >}}  
I’m preparing a presentation on [topic]. Here are some notes:  
- Key idea 1  
- Key idea 2  
- Key idea 3  

Please organize these into an outline for a 10-minute presentation.  
{{< /copyable >}}  

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>  

**Why This Helps**: GenAI can turn raw ideas into a logical framework, making it easier to focus on crafting engaging content.  

---

#### Step 2: Develop Content for Each Section  

Once you have an outline, expand each section with key points, examples, and transitions.  

{{< copyable >}}  
Based on this outline:  
1. Introduction to [topic]  
2. Key benefits of [idea]  
3. Challenges and solutions  
4. Call to action  

Please provide 3-4 talking points for each section.  
{{< /copyable >}}  

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>  

**Outcome**: You’ll have a detailed draft for each part of your presentation, helping you focus on refining your narrative.  

---

#### Step 3: Enhance Structure and Visual Appeal  

Strong presentations need a clear flow and engaging visuals. Ask GenAI to suggest slide titles, layouts, or visual elements for each section.  

{{< copyable >}}  
Based on the previous talking points, suggest slide titles and layouts. Include recommendations for visuals or diagrams.  
{{< /copyable >}}  

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>  

**Insight**: While GenAI can suggest visual ideas, you’ll add the creative polish that aligns with your style.  

---

#### Step 4: Refine Language and Flow  

With content drafted, focus on clarity and professionalism. Ask GenAI to rephrase sections, simplify language, or suggest transitions between slides.  

{{< copyable >}}  
Here’s a [DRAFT] for a slide. I think that it doesn't fully motivate the problem or paves the way to the main idea. I'm not sure how to go about this.

[DRAFT]:
_your draft goes here_  

Can you suggest relevant modifications?  
{{< /copyable >}}  

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>  

**Outcome**: You’ll improve readability and ensure your presentation resonates with the audience.  

---

#### Step 5: Practice with GenAI as Your Audience  

Before presenting, practice by using GenAI as your audience. It can simulate Q&A sessions or provide feedback on your delivery.  

{{< copyable >}}  
Based on this presentation, what questions might the audience ask? How can I address them effectively?

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>  

**Why This Works**: Anticipating questions and refining your delivery ensures confidence and a stronger connection with your audience.
