## Bridging the Gap Between Vision and Validation

In [Monday's article](/posts/gen_ai/week_11/article/), we explored how GenAI can guide you from idea to reality when starting a business. Today, we'll take a practical step further: creating a strong business pitch and a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). 

A pitch clarifies the “why” behind your business, while the MVP focuses on the “how.” Together, they form the foundation of your entrepreneurial journey. With GenAI as your ***Thinking Buddy***, you'll be equipped to refine your message, validate your idea, and gain clarity on your next steps.

### The Tool of the Week: Parallel Refinement

Our featured tool this week is:

This approach involves refining multiple components—like your business pitch and MVP—simultaneously to ensure they complement and strengthen each other.

**Why This Helps**: By working on the pitch and MVP in parallel, you can align your messaging with your product strategy, making both more cohesive and effective.

### Step-by-Step: Building Your Business Pitch and MVP with GenAI

### Step 1: Define the Core Problem

Every business starts with solving a problem. To build a strong foundation for both your pitch and MVP, you need to clearly define the issue your idea addresses and why it matters.

- **How GenAI Helps**: Your ***Thinking Buddy*** can ask probing questions to uncover the real pain points and identify how your solution stands out.
- **What You'll Achieve**: A problem statement that anchors your business idea and resonates with potential customers and stakeholders.

**_Prompt to Try:_**

I'm building a business around [idea]. Help me better frame the core problem it solves. Ask me questions about the target audience, the challenges they face, and why existing solutions fall short. Then summarize the problem in a concise statement.

- **Target Audience Alignment**: Explore how different customer segments might perceive this problem.

### Step 2: Draft a Value Proposition

Your value proposition is the “why choose us” element of your pitch. It articulates how your business solves the problem better than alternatives.

- **What You'll Achieve**: A polished statement that succinctly communicates your business's value to customers and investors.
