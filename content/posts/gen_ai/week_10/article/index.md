## Challenges to Keep in Mind

While GenAI can significantly enhance personal strategic planning, it's important to approach it critically:

1. **Bias in Outputs**: AI models may reflect cultural or data biases, so use your judgment to ensure suggestions are relevant and inclusive.
2. **Emphasis on Iteration**: The first draft from GenAI often requires refinement—success lies in collaborating and iterating with the AI.
3. **Balancing AI Insights with Intuition**: GenAI can provide ideas, but only you can determine what truly aligns with your aspirations.
