## Learning the Ropes: GenAI Mistakes to Avoid

Starting with Generative AI (GenAI) feels a bit like meeting up with a very knowledgeable friend from high school who’s now practically a walking encyclopedia. They’ve got a Ph.D. in just about everything, and they’re ready to help! But, as smart as they are, they’re still human (okay, not quite human) and might make a mistake here and there. Instead of giving up at the first slip-up, we can navigate these quirks, refine our prompts, and build a reliable AI companion.

Here are six common GenAI pitfalls I encountered when first diving in and have seen others make the same mistakes. They all come with practical ways to avoid them.

### 1. Expecting Perfection from GenAI

Imagine you’re reconnecting with that brilliant friend from high school who’s now your go-to for any question—tech, health, travel plans, they have a Ph.D. in it all. But despite their incredible knowledge, they’re only human and sometimes make mistakes. GenAI is a lot like that friend: it’s here to offer guidance, but it’s still learning and can be a little overconfident in its answers. 

**Solution:** When using GenAI, think of it as a collaborative partner, not a perfect solution. Double-check its suggestions, especially if you’re asking about something important. Just like you’d verify advice from a friend, fact-check GenAI’s responses and see them as a starting point rather than a final answer. If it makes a mistake, take it in stride—note the error and continue working together. This approach helps you maintain trust in GenAI’s potential while keeping realistic expectations.

### 2. Not Providing Enough Context

A common mistake is expecting meaningful results from a one-liner like, “What should I do today?” It’s a lot like asking your well-informed friend an open-ended question without any context—they’d need some details to give useful advice.

**Solution:** Give GenAI a few clues to guide its response. Instead of “What should I do today?” try something more specific, like “I’m visiting New York, love history, and want to avoid large crowds.” By including details like preferences, location, or goals, you’ll receive answers that are tailored to your needs. Think of it like having a conversation with a friend—provide just enough context to help GenAI get where you’re coming from, and it’ll surprise you with relevant, thoughtful responses.

### 3. Limiting Use Due to Privacy Concerns

Privacy is a natural concern, and it’s easy to feel wary of sharing anything with GenAI. Many avoid using GenAI altogether, worried that it will retain every word, even with privacy settings. It’s true we should be cautious, but GenAI tools often have privacy options that can address these concerns.

**Solution:** Disable memory or learning features and stick to general queries rather than personal information if privacy is a top priority. Just like on social media or messaging apps, avoid including highly sensitive information. Most GenAI tools offer ways to prevent long-term data storage—similar to going incognito on your browser. Use it wisely, and you’ll find it’s possible to access GenAI’s benefits without sacrificing peace of mind.

### 4. Ending the Conversation Too Soon

Another common misstep is not taking advantage of GenAI’s iterative responses. Sometimes we stop at the first reply, missing the chance for better answers by refining the conversation, a lot like stopping mid-conversation with that brilliant friend.

**Solution:** Use follow-up prompts to get closer to the answer you’re seeking. Ask GenAI to clarify if the first response doesn’t hit the mark or guide it with additional questions like “Can you rephrase that in simpler terms?” A little back-and-forth helps GenAI refine its responses, just as it would with a human. By keeping the conversation going, you’ll see your results become increasingly meaningful and helpful.

### 5. Expecting a Fully Finished Answer for Complex Problems

While GenAI can assist in fields like coding, finance, or technical areas, it shouldn’t be expected to give fully structured, bullet-proof arguments for specialized fields. Think of it like talking to that high school friend who’s now an academic—they can offer insights, but they’re not going to hand over a ready-to-go professional document.

For example, a lawyer friend recently mentioned they wouldn’t use GenAI for complete arguments but found it helpful to test the strength of their reasoning. They used it to point out weak spots in their draft arguments, which they could then improve.

**Solution:** Rather than expecting a complete answer, use GenAI for feedback, outline suggestions, or draft ideas that you can refine yourself. This approach works particularly well in areas where expertise is critical. It’s like getting a second opinion that highlights possible improvements rather than delivering a final, professional-grade product.

### 6. Misunderstanding Task Goals and Getting Off-Track

Sometimes, users start working with GenAI and assume it understands what they’re after, leading to responses that don’t quite fit. This is like asking your well-informed friend for advice without clarifying your goal—they may answer based on their interpretation of your needs rather than what you actually intended.

**Solution:** Make sure GenAI is on the same page before diving in. One way to do this is to prompt it to explain what it thinks you’re looking to achieve. For instance, say, “Can you summarize the task we’re working on?” or ask, “What questions would help you understand this better?” This will let you confirm that it’s interpreting your prompt correctly and give you a chance to clear up any confusion early on. By setting clear goals, you’re guiding GenAI to produce responses that align with what you need.

## Final Thoughts: Navigating Your GenAI Journey

The best way to make GenAI a productive part of your routine is to approach it with a learning mindset and clear communication. You don’t expect a human friend to be perfect, so approach GenAI with the same patience. With the right prompts, context, and realistic expectations, it can be an excellent partner for everything from brainstorming to solving complex challenges.
