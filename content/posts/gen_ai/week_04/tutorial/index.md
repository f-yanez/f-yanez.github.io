## Using AI to Make Bedtime Stories Extra Special

Bedtime stories have always been a cherished tradition, and with Generative AI, we can bring a new level of personalization to them. Imagine creating a unique story for your child, niece, nephew, where the main character has their name, favorite animals, or even goes on adventures in familiar places. Today, we’ll explore how to use GenAI to craft custom bedtime stories that capture your child’s imagination. We’ll also tap into a handy GenAI tool, **Specifying the Format**, so you can download the story in formats like **pdf** for reading on your device during bedtime (even .doc or .csv if you are working with documents or tables, respectively).

Hang on until the end to read the full conversation with Chat GPT!

### The Tool of the Week: Specifying the Format

First up, let’s talk about our featured tool for this week:


{{< mark >}}Specify the Format{{< /mark >}}


By specifying the format, we can make sure that the AI provides the story in the way we want to access it. For example, if we’d like to download it as a **pdf**, we can let the AI know right in the prompt. This means the story will be easy to access on most devices. Here’s an example prompt:


{{< copyable >}}
Write a bedtime story in pdf format about a young girl named Natalia who befriends a talking panda and learns about the stars on a magical night adventure.
{{< /copyable >}}


<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>

By adding the format, GenAI will prepare the story in a downloadable version, ready for tonight’s storytime.

### Step-by-Step: Creating a Custom Bedtime Story

#### Step 1: **Assign a Role and Tone**

As we saw during the hands-on of [week 1](/posts/gen_ai/week_01/tutorial/) and [week 2](/posts/gen_ai/week_02/tutorial/), setting up the role and tone give the GenAI a clear direction on how to formulate its answer. Let it know the type of story you’re looking for by assigning it the role of a bedtime storyteller. Then, add details on the tone you’d like, whether it’s soothing, magical, funny, or adventurous.


{{< copyable >}}
You are a bedtime storyteller. We will write a gentle, magical story for a child who loves animals. The story should include a fox and a deer who explore an enchanted forest together with their wizard friend Lucas. What storylines can you think of? Give me five options.

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>

**What this does:** By setting the role and tone, the GenAI understands that the story should be calm and magical, creating an atmosphere perfect for bedtime.

#### Step 2: **Provide Personal Context for Customization**

Next, personalize the story a bit more by adding details that will make it special. Think about your some interests or favorite things, and include them in the prompt. This could be as simple as a name, favorite animal, or even a theme like outer space or underwater adventures.

Let's go with the third option. Lucas is 4 years old and loves solving puzzles. He also learned about taking care of nature at school this week, so we can also add that into the story.

<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>

**Why this works:** Adding these details makes the story feel custom-made, making the experience even more memorable.

#### Step 3: **Specify the Output Format for Easy Download**

Finally, made any edits if necessary and specify the format you’d like the story in. This is particularly useful if you want to store it on a device or print it out for easy access. 


{{< copyable >}}
Now give me the story in pdf format and give me the step-by-step to open it on my phone so I can read it during bedtime.
{{< /copyable >}}


<p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">  
<em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>  
</p>

**The result:** A ready-to-download story that you can easily read before bed, adding a magical ending to the day.
