## Getting Started the Easy Way

Have you ever wished you had an extra hand for those daily tasks that pile up? That’s where Generative AI (GenAI) can step in—not to take over, but to work *with you*, helping to bring your ideas to life and accelerate those small but important tasks. Today, we're diving into two easy-to-use AI tools that act as a digital companion, enhancing your productivity, creativity, and daily routines. No expertise is required—just a willingness to explore!

### The "Try It Out" Mindset

Before we get into specific tools, let's set the stage: **Using AI is not about perfection; it's about experimentation.** Think of these tools as your **digital buddies**—they’re here to offer suggestions, provide a jump-start, and help refine your thoughts. And just like a friend giving you advice, it’s up to you to decide what works and what to tweak. So, let’s dive in with the mindset of trying things out and exploring what fits!

### Everyday AI: Your Helpful Sidekick

Imagine having a digital companion that can help you learn something new, brainstorm ideas, or plan out your week. AI tools can assist in all these areas and more, providing that extra nudge to get you started or helping you polish up what you've already created. Below are a few beginner-friendly AI tools that can support you in various daily activities. Let's walk through what they do, how they can help, and some simple steps to get you started.

{{< vs 1 >}}

### 1. **ChatGPT – Your Conversational Companion**
- **Overview:** ChatGPT is like having a creative assistant who can help you organize thoughts, write emails, brainstorm ideas, or even answer questions you might have. It’s not about replacing your input but enhancing it. For example, if you’re stuck on learning a new concept, ChatGPT can provide more information, leaving it to you to decide how deep you want to get into it.
- **Account:** It is not necessary to go for the Pro account, especially if you are beginning your journey. Their current free version is still very impressive anyway. **Privacy Note:** If privacy is something that concerns you, OpenAI allows you to disable ChatGPT's memory in their [personalization settings](https://chatgpt.com/#settings/Personalization) and even have ["temporary chats"](https://chatgpt.com/?temporary-chat=true) by clicking on the top-left corner where the model name is and toggling the "Temporary chat" option.

- **Some Use Cases:** ChatGPT can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as drafting emails, creating to-do lists, brainstorming ideas, and even providing thoughtful responses to more complex questions. Here are some specific scenarios to show its versatility:
  - **Writing Assistance:** ChatGPT can be your personal editor. It can help you organize your writing, make sure you are not missing any important piece of information, or even translate it into most languages. You can use different tools—like the one we [discussed last Thursday](/posts/gen_ai/week_01/tutorial/)—as well. Try setting a role for it to play and prompt it with:

  {{< copyable >}}
  I've been working on something and I would like your assistance. Take the role of the editor for the New York Times as this is an editorial piece I'm working on.
  {{< /copyable >}}

  <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">
  <em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>
  </p>

  - **Idea Refinement:** ChatGPT can help you structure the thoughts or opinions you have on any subject. You can stress-test your ideas and it will help you lay them out in a comprehensible and structured way. Try to prompt it with the following:

  {{< copyable >}}
  I want to stress-test an idea I've been having for a while. Can you help me with that?
  {{< /copyable >}}

  <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">
  <em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>
  </p>

  - **Brainstorming:** ChatGPT can help you brainstorm topics. It’ll offer a variety of angles, which you can then refine or combine. Try out:

  {{< copyable >}}
  I'm hosting a games night with some friends. Can you help me with that? I want to plan some games outside of the common mainstream ones.
  {{< /copyable >}}

  <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">
  <em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>
  </p>

  - **Planning:** ChatGPT can help you suggesting a structured plan based on your needs and asks. For instance, try asking:

 {{< copyable >}}
  I am currently working on multiple projects and have some deliverables due this week. Can you help me organize the to-do's for each of them and prioritize them? You should know, I'm not so good at context-switching, so it would be ideal for me to finish one deliverable at a time. However, given that some tasks have some idle time, I could work on something similar meanwhile.

  <em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>
  </p>


### 2. **Grammarly – Your Writing Assistant**
- **Overview:** [Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/) helps you polish your writing by suggesting changes to grammar, tone, and clarity. Think of it as having an editor by your side, making sure your message comes across the way you intend. It’s not limited to just one platform—you can use Grammarly across various devices and applications, making it a versatile tool for everyday tasks.
- **Use Cases:** Proofreading emails, refining social media posts, editing documents, and even checking for tone in messaging apps.
- **Quick Start:** Copy and paste an email draft into Grammarly, and watch as it makes suggestions like “Consider changing this word to make your tone more friendly.” You’re still in control of the final message, choosing which suggestions to accept.

##### **Extended Capabilities: Using Grammarly Across Platforms**
- **[Chrome Extension](https://www.grammarly.com/browser/chrome):** Grammarly integrates directly into your browser so you can use it seamlessly on various websites. Whether you're typing out a LinkedIn post, drafting an email in Gmail, or writing a blog post, Grammarly’s real-time suggestions appear directly as you type, ensuring clarity and correctness on the go.
- **[Windows](https://www.grammarly.com/desktop/windows) and [Mac](https://www.grammarly.com/desktop/mac) Integrations:** Grammarly offers a native Desktop app that can be used across multiple applications. This means you can enjoy Grammarly’s writing suggestions in your word processing software without the need to copy and paste text back and forth.

### Wrapping It Up: AI as Your Everyday Companion

These are the two AI tools that I use everyday, but remember: they are meant to assist, not take over. Think of them as **digital companions** that help you get started, refine ideas, and simplify small tasks. The magic happens when you engage with them, guiding their outputs to fit your needs. So, why not give one of these tools a try today?
