## ChatGPT as Your Life Coach

Quite often I feel like I'm stuck in a loop, going over the same problems or decisions in my head over and over again. Has this happened to you too? Sometimes I feel like all I need is someone to hear my thoughts and help me ride all the emotions by asking the right questions. If you relate, I have great news for you. Yes, relying on a family member, friends, mentors, or even getting a life coach are great alternatives. The downside is that most likely you won't have access to them 24/7 for as long as you want or need. That's where tools like **ChatGPT** can come in handy—not to give us the answers but to guide our own reflections. It’s like having a personal coach to bounce your thoughts off of, anytime, anywhere—granted, given an internet connection.


The use case we'll try out today turns GPT into a **life coach** that can help you reflect on challenges, personal goals, or even bigger life decisions. It’s not about finding *the* solution right away, but more about breaking things down, exploring your mindset, and figuring out what really matters to you. I'll include the link to the full conversation if you want to get a better idea of how deep you can get, but for now here is a step-by-step summary.

### How to Use Setting a Tone or Style with Generative AI

Let’s introduce the tool of the week:

{{< mark >}}Set a Tone or Style{{< /mark >}}

Like we [explored on Monday](/posts/gen_ai/week_02/article/), GenAI is like having a creative assistant who can help you organize ideas. It’s not about replacing your thought process but enhancing it. One way to get better results tailored to what you need or want is by giving the AI a specific tone or style for its responses. For example, you can ask ChatGPT to respond in a **casual, friendly tone** if you want your interaction to feel more relaxed, or you might prefer a more **formal, structured tone** when dealing with professional or sensitive topics.

### Use Case: ChatGPT as Your Personal Coach

#### Step-by-Step: Using ChatGPT with a Specific Tone to Assist our Thought Process

##### Step 1: Set the Scene — Define the Role and Tone

First things first, you’ll want to give GPT a little context. You’re essentially asking it to play a role, and for this scenario, it’ll act as your compassionate life coach. Let it know what you’re dealing with or what area of your life you’re reflecting on:

{{< copyable >}}
You’re my life coach. You have a compassionate tone, but at the same time assertive. I feel stuck in my career right now and need help figuring out what’s holding me back. Can you help clarify my thoughts?
{{< /copyable >}}


  <p style="text-align: right; font-size: 10px;">
  <em>Copy the <b>prompt</b> and try it with <a href="https://chatgpt.com">ChatGPT</a></em>
  </p>


**What happens next:** By setting the role and the tone, you’re giving ChatGPT the context it needs to provide suggestions that more aligned with what you need in that moment.

##### Step 2: Get Some Thoughtful Questions

Here’s where the magic happens. GPT will respond with reflective, open-ended questions to help you dig deeper into what might be causing you to feel stuck.

**What ChatGPT might ask:**
- "Do you feel like you're learning and growing?"
- "Do you have a clear vision for your future?"

It's kind of like having a friend who’s really good at asking those *right* questions—the ones that make you stop and think.

##### Step 3: Reflect and Iterate

Now, this part is where things get interesting. After ChatGPT asks you some thoughtful questions, you can start reflecting on your answers. Since it usually numbers the questions, I like responding with the same number sequence as it will be able to match a question with its answer. Then, it might ask follow-ups based on your responses, helping you uncover things you hadn’t considered before. You'll be surprised how much clarity you can get from just having someone (or something) help you frame your own thoughts.

##### Step 4: Make a Plan

Once you’ve done some reflection and feel like you’ve got a better grip on what’s going on, ask ChatGPT to help you make a plan. This is where the life-coach role really kicks in. It can help you outline actionable steps toward solving the issue or moving toward your goals. For example, you could try a prompt like this:


{{< copyable >}}
I am quite interested in everything we have discussed so far. Please help me come up with a plan of actionable items I can work on each day next week.
{{< /copyable >}}


{{< img src="/posts/shortcodes/week2_tutorial_img_2.png" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" align="center" title="Image showing ChatGPT providing a personalized plan with actionable items based on a career and life discussion." >}}

As we can see, by tweaking the tone, you can make your interaction with ChatGPT feel even more personal and aligned with your current needs.

## Final Takeaways

The power of this approach is that it turns **reflection into a conversation**. Sometimes we just need a sounding board to sort out our thoughts, and ChatGPT can play that role with the tone you have in mind. It’s not giving you a definitive solution, but it’s helping you uncover what’s already there—just waiting for the right nudge.
