These posts are just meant to be my initiation into daily writing. I don't expect them to be neat and tidy, with a meaningful structure and clarity. For now, I'm just focusing on building the habit and getting rid of the "blank-page fear"". Thus, I will likely not proof-read them: first building the habit with the instant gratification of posting them here, and then start with the auto-criticism in order to improve my actual writing skills. I hope this short explanation helps your expectations to match mine.
