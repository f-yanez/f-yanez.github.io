&lt;p>In December 2016, while volunteering in Curitiba, Brazil, I came across a saying that deeply resonated with me: “&lt;em>tudo vai dar certo&lt;/em>”, which translates to “everything will turn out right”. This phrase reflected my approach to situations, where I focused on making the right decisions and believed that favorable outcomes would follow.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Knowledge Acquisition vs. Knowledge Production</title><link>https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/the_happiness_project/knowledge_acquisition_vs_knowledge_production/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/the_happiness_project/knowledge_acquisition_vs_knowledge_production/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="how-should-i-spend-my-idle-time">How should I spend my idle time?&lt;/h3>

&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Walking had an added benefit: it helped me to think. Nietzsche wrote, &lt;strong>&amp;lsquo;All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong>&amp;rdquo;&lt;br>

&lt;p>Since moving to Toronto, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen biking as my preferred method of transportation. The benefits include a fair share of cardio, getting to places quickly, and the opportunity to listen to audiobooks or podcasts. However, the speed also means less time to make progress in my listening affairs. I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering whether walking is a better alternative, in other words, if the balance between travel time and time to read/listen should tilt towards the latter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Being the Odd One Out</title><link>https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/the_happiness_project/being_the_odd_one_out/</link><pubDate>Sun, 02 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0600</pubDate><guid>https://f-yanez.github.io/posts/the_happiness_project/being_the_odd_one_out/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="be-weird-in-a-good-way">Be weird, in a good way&lt;/h3>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;My sister said, ‘I don’t think you realize just how weird you are—but,’ she added hastily, ‘in a good way&amp;rsquo;.&amp;quot;&lt;p>

&lt;p>I often reflect on a particular phrase that captures my feelings of being different in a casual yet effective way. I&amp;rsquo;m usually the odd one out—the one who doesn&amp;rsquo;t get hot chocolate at a Christmas market because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring the same joy as my mom&amp;rsquo;s, or the one who stays quiet for hours at gatherings because I prefer discussing ideas and concepts rather than people. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to embrace this uniqueness instead of running away from it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
